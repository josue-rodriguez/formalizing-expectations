  abstract = {In neuroscience, experimental designs in which multiple observations are collected from a single research object (for example, multiple neurons from one animal) are common: 53\% of 314 reviewed papers from five renowned journals included this type of data. These so-called 'nested designs' yield data that cannot be considered to be independent, and so violate the independency assumption of conventional statistical methods such as the t test. Ignoring this dependency results in a probability of incorrectly concluding that an e ect is statistically significant that is far higher (up to 80\%) than the nominal a level (usually set at 5\%). We discuss the factors a ecting the type I error rate and the statistical power in nested data, methods that accommodate dependency between observations and ways to determine the optimal study design when data are nested. Notably, optimization of experimental designs nearly always concerns collection of more truly independent observations, rather than more observations from one research object.},

  abstract = {Background
The role of symptom overlap between major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder in comorbidity between two disorders is unclear. The current study applied network analysis to map the structure of symptom associations between these disorders.
Methods
Data comes from a sample of 909 Australian adults with a lifetime history of trauma and depressive symptoms. Data analysis consisted of the construction of two comorbidity networks of PTSD/MDD with and without overlapping symptoms, identification of the bridging symptoms, and computation of the centrality measures.
Results
The prominent bridging role of four overlapping symptoms (i.e., sleep problems, irritability, concentration problems, and loss of interest) and five non-overlapping symptoms (i.e., feeling sad, feelings of guilt, psychomotor retardation, foreshortened future, and experiencing flashbacks) is highlighted.
Limitations
The current study uses DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and does not take into consideration significant changes made to PTSD criteria in DSM-5. Moreover, due to cross-sectional nature of the data, network estimates do not provide information on whether a symptom actively triggers other symptoms or whether a symptom mostly is triggered by other symptoms.
Conclusion
The results support the role of dysphoria-related symptoms in PTSD/MDD comorbidity. Moreover, Identification of central symptoms and bridge symptoms will provide useful targets for interventions that seek to intervene early in the development of comorbidity.},

When hypotheses are heterogeneous in priors or intrinsic interest, we find that a hybrid approach which prespecifies hypotheses with high weights and priors and uses a split-sample approach to test additional hypotheses can have power gains over any pure PAP. We assess this approach using the community-driven development (CDD) application from Casey et al. (2012) and find that the use of a hybrid split-sample approach would have generated qualitatively different conclusions.},

  abstract = {Objective: Recent developments in psychometrics enable the application of network models to analyze psychological disorders, such as PTSD. Instead of understanding symptoms as indicators of an underlying common cause, this approach suggests symptoms co-occur in syndromes due to causal interactions. The current study has two goals: (1) examine the network structure among the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and (2) incorporate clinically relevant variables to the network to investigate whether PTSD symptoms exhibit differential relationships with suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, physical functioning/quality of life (QoL), mental functioning/QoL, age, and sex.
Method: We utilized a nationally representative U.S. military veteran's sample; and analyzed the data from a subsample of 221 veterans who reported clinically significant DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Networks were estimated using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models. Data and code are published along with the paper.
Results: The 20-item DSM-5 PTSD network revealed that symptoms were positively connected within the network. Especially strong connections emerged between nightmares and flashbacks; blame of self or others and negative trauma-related emotions, detachment and restricted affect; and hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response. The most central symptoms were negative trauma-related emotions, flashbacks, detachment, and physiological cue reactivity. Incorporation of clinically relevant covariates into the network revealed paths between self-destructive behavior and suicidal ideation; concentration difficulties and anxiety, depression, and mental QoL; and depression and restricted affect.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and suggest differential associations between specific DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and clinical outcomes in trauma survivors. Implications of these results for informing the assessment and treatment of this disorder, are discussed.},

Several researchers have suggested that altruism is a costly signal of desirable qualities, such that it could have evolved by sexual selection. In two studies, we show that altruism is broadly linked with mating success. In Study 1, participants who scored higher on a self-report altruism measure reported they were more desirable to the opposite sex, as well as reported having more sex partners, more casual sex partners, and having sex more often within relationships. Sex moderated some of these relationships, such that altruism mattered more for men's number of lifetime and casual sex partners. In Study 2, participants who were willing to donate potential monetary winnings (in a modified dictator dilemma) reported having more lifetime sex partners, more casual sex partners, and more sex partners over the past year. Men who were willing to donate also reported having more lifetime dating partners. Furthermore, these patterns persisted, even when controlling for narcissism, Big Five personality traits, and socially desirable responding. These results suggest that altruists have higher mating success than non-altruists and support the hypothesis that altruism is a sexually selected costly signal of difficult-to-observe qualities.},

However, this method is relatively unknown among researchers and, to date, has not been widely used in meta-analytic research. Therefore, the purpose of this tutorial was to show how a three-level random effects model can be applied to meta-analytic models in R using the rma.mv function of the metafor package. This application is illustrated by taking the reader through a step-by-step guide to the multilevel analyses comprising the steps of (1) organizing a data file; (2) setting up the R environment; (3) calculating an overall effect; (4) examining heterogeneity of within-study variance and between-study variance; (5) performing categorical and continuous moderator analyses; and (6) examining a multiple moderator model. By example, the authors demonstrate how the multilevel approach can be applied to meta-analytically examining the association between mental health disorders of juveniles and juvenile offender recidivism. In our opinion, the rma.mv function of the metafor package provides an easy and flexible way of applying a multi-level structure to meta-analytic models in R. Further, the multilevel meta-analytic models can be easily extended so that the potential moderating influence of variables can be examined.},

In order to model a covariance matrix effectively, it is typically broken down into components based on modeling considerations or mathematical convenience. Decompositions that have received recent research attention include variance components, spectral decomposition, Cholesky decomposition, and matrix logarithm. In this paper we study a statistically motivated decomposition which appears to be relatively unexplored for the purpose of modeling. We model a covariance matrix in terms of its corresponding standard deviations and correlation matrix. We discuss two general modeling situations where this approach is useful: shrinkage estimation of regression coefficients, and a general location-scale model for both categorical and continuous variables. We present some simple choices for priors in terms of standard deviations and the correlation matrix, and describe a straightforward computational strategy for obtaining the posterior of the covariance matrix. We apply our method to real and simulated data sets in the context of shrinkage estimation.},

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

              Researchers have studied psychological disorders extensively from a common cause perspective, in which symptoms are treated as independent indicators of an underlying disease. In contrast, the causal systems perspective seeks to understand the importance of individual symptoms and symptom-to-symptom relationships. In the current study, we used network analysis to examine the relationships between and among depression and anxiety symptoms from the causal systems perspective.
            
            
              Method

                N

              Individual symptoms of depression and anxiety were more related to other symptoms within each disorder than to symptoms between disorders. Sad mood and worry were among the most central symptoms in the network. The network structure was stable both at admission and between admission and discharge, although the overall strength of symptom relationships increased as symptom severity decreased over the course of treatment.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Examining depression and anxiety symptoms as dynamic systems may provide novel insights into the maintenance of these mental health problems.},

On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.},

  abstract = {In statistical practice, researchers commonly focus on patterns in the means of multiple dependent outcomes while treating variances as nuisance parameters. However, in fact, there are often substantive reasons to expect certain patterns in the variances of dependent outcomes as well. For example, in a repeated measures study, one may expect the variance of the outcome to increase over time if the difference between subjects becomes more pronounced over time because the subjects respond differently to a given treatment. Such expectations can be formulated as order constrained hypotheses on the variances of the dependent outcomes. Currently, however, no methods exist for testing such hypotheses in a direct manner. To fill this gap, we develop a Bayes factor for this challenging testing problem. Our Bayes factor is based on the multivariate normal distribution with an unstructured covariance matrix, which is often used to model dependent outcomes. Order constrained hypotheses can then be formulated on the variances on the diagonal of the covariance matrix. To compute Bayes factors between multiple order constrained hypotheses, a prior distribution needs to be specified under every hypothesis to be tested. Here, we use the encompassing prior approach in which priors under order constrained hypotheses are truncations of the prior under the unconstrained hypothesis. The resulting Bayes factor is fully automatic in the sense that no subjective priors need to be specified by the user.},

Comparing and testing variances is therefore of crucial importance to understand the effect of a grouping variable on an outcome variable. Researchers may have specific expectations concerning the relations between the variances of multiple groups. Such expectations can be translated into hypotheses with inequality and/or equality constraints on the group variances. Currently, however, no methods are available for testing (in)equality constrained hypotheses on variances. This article proposes a novel Bayesian approach to this challenging testing problem. Our approach has the following useful properties: First, it can be used to simultaneously test multiple (non)nested hypotheses with equality as well as inequality constraints on the variances. Second, our approach is fully automatic in the sense that no subjective prior specification is needed. Only the hypotheses need to be provided. Third, a user-friendly software application is included that can be used to perform this Bayesian test in an easy manner.},

  abstract = {Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the ``wrong'' answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.},

In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

Mental disorders are highly comorbid: people having one disorder are likely to have another as well. We explain empirical comorbidity patterns based on a network model of psychiatric symptoms, derived from an analysis of symptom overlap in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV).

Principal Findings
We show that a) half of the symptoms in the DSM-IV network are connected, b) the architecture of these connections conforms to a small world structure, featuring a high degree of clustering but a short average path length, and c) distances between disorders in this structure predict empirical comorbidity rates. Network simulations of Major Depressive Episode and Generalized Anxiety Disorder show that the model faithfully reproduces empirical population statistics for these disorders.

Conclusions
In the network model, mental disorders are inherently complex. This explains the limited successes of genetic, neuroscientific, and etiological approaches to unravel their causes. We outline a psychosystems approach to investigate the structure and dynamics of mental disorders.},

TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies empirical phenomena to become the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a proto-theory: a set of theoretical principles that potentially explain these phenomena. Third, the proto-theory is used to construct a formal model: a set of model equations or simulation models that encode the explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates this model's explanatory adequacy. This is done by formalizing the empirical phenomena in terms of the model, and assessing whether the model indeed reproduces them. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully, whether explanatory principles are parsimonious and substantively plausible, and whether the theory implies new predictions to promote further research. We illustrate TCM with an example taken from the intelligence literature (the mutualism model of intelligence), discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research, and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

Both measures are based on the weighted L2L2L\^\{2\}-distance of quantities related to the characteristic functions of the underlying random variables. These extend distance covariance (introduced by Sz{\'e}kely, Rizzo and Bakirov) from pairs of random variables to nnn-tuplets of random variables. We show that total distance multivariance can be used to detect the independence of nnn random variables and has a simple finite-sample representation in terms of distance matrices of the sample points, where distance is measured by a continuous negative definite function. Under some mild moment conditions, this leads to a test for independence of multiple random vectors which is consistent against all alternatives.},

  abstract = {Assessing the relative importance of predictors has been of historical importance in a variety of disciplines including management, medicine, economics, and psychology. When approaching hypotheses on the relative ordering of the magnitude of predicted effects (e.g., the effects of discrimination from managers and coworkers are larger than that from clients), one quickly runs into problems within a traditional frequentist framework. Null hypothesis significance testing does not allow researchers to directly map research hypotheses on to results and suffers from a multiple testing problem that leads to low statistical power. Furthermore, all traditional structural equation modeling fit indices lose much of their suitability for model comparison, because order hypotheses are not countable in terms of degrees of freedom. To adequately tackle order hypotheses, we advocate a Bayesian method that provides a single internally consistent solution for estimation and inference. The key element in the proposed model comparison approach is the use of the Bayes factor and the incorporation of order constraints by means of a smart formulation of prior distributions. An easy-to-use software package BIEMS (Bayesian inequality and equality constrained model selection) is introduced and two empirical examples in the organizational behavior area are provided to showcase the method, both offering new findings that have implications for theory: the first on the differential impact of discrimination in the workplace from insiders and outsiders to the organization on employees' well-being, and the second on Karasek's stressor\textendash{}strain theory about how the relative order of magnitude of the effects of job control and demands depends on the specific well-being outcome dimension.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

This suggests that it is necessary to study how symptoms dynamically interact over time in a network architecture. In the present paper, we show how such an architecture can be constructed on the basis of time-series data obtained through Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM). The proposed methodology determines the parameters for the interaction between nodes in the network by estimating a multilevel vector autoregression (VAR) model on the data. The methodology allows combining between-subject and within-subject information in a multilevel framework. The resulting network architecture can subsequently be analyzed through network analysis techniques. In the present study, we apply the method to a set of items that assess mood-related factors. We show that the analysis generates a plausible and replicable network architecture, the structure of which is related to variables such as neuroticism; that is, for subjects who score high on neuroticism, worrying plays a more central role in the network. Implications and extensions of the methodology are discussed.},

As centrality indices were originally developed in the context of social networks, it is unclear to what extent these indices are suitable in a psychological network context. In this paper we critically examine several issues with the use of the most popular centrality indices in psychological networks: degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality. We show that problems with centrality indices discussed in the social network literature also apply to the psychological networks. Assumptions underlying centrality indices, such as presence of a flow and shortest paths, may not correspond with a general theory of how psychological variables relate to one another. Furthermore, the assumptions of node distinctiveness and node exchangeability may not hold in psychological networks. We conclude that, for psychological networks, betweenness and closeness centrality seem especially unsuitable as measures of node importance. We therefore suggest three ways forward: (1) using centrality measures that are tailored to the psychological network context, (2) reconsidering existing measures of importance used in statistical models underlying psychological networks, and (3) discarding the concept of node centrality entirely. Foremost, we argue that one has to make explicit what one means when one states that a node is central, and what assumptions the centrality measure of choice entails, to make sure that there is a match between the process under study and the centrality measure that is used.},

The model extends the standard two-way cross-classified random-intercept model (respondents nested in interviewers crossed with areas) by specifying the residual variance to be a function of covariates and an additional interviewer random effect. This extension provides a way to study interviewers' effects on not just the `location' (mean) of respondents' responses, but additionally on their `scale' (variability). It therefore allows researchers to address new questions such as `Do interviewers influence the variability of their respondents' responses in addition to their average, and if so why?'. In doing so, the model facilitates a more complete and flexible assessment of the factors that are associated with interviewer error. We illustrate this model by using data from wave 3 of the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, which we link to a range of interviewer characteristics measured in an independent survey of interviewers. By identifying both interviewer characteristics in general, but also specific interviewers who are associated with unusually high or low or homogeneous or heterogeneous responses, the model provides a way to inform improvements to survey quality.},

Information-theoretic approaches emphasise a deliberate focus on the a priori science in developing a set of multiple working hypotheses or models. Simple methods then allow these hypotheses (models) to be ranked from best to worst and scaled to reflect a strength of evidence using the likelihood of each model (gi), given the data and the models in the set (i.e. L(gi | data)). In addition, a variance component due to model-selection uncertainty is included in estimates of precision. There are many cases where formal inference can be based on all the models in the a priori set and this multi-model inference represents a powerful, new approach to valid inference. Finally, we strongly recommend inferences based on a priori considerations be carefully separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging. An example is given for questions related to age- and sex-dependent rates of tag loss in elephant seals (Mirounga leonina).},

However, the evidence confirming this hypothesis is scarce. This study re-analyzed a convenience sample of 51 cross-sectional psychopathological networks published in previous studies addressing diverse mental disorders or clinically relevant problems. In order to address the hypothesis that central and bridge symptoms are valuable treatment targets, this study simulated five distinct attack conditions on the psychopathological networks by deactivating symptoms based on two characteristics of central symptoms (degree and strength), two characteristics of bridge symptoms (overlap and bridgeness), and at random. The differential impact of the characteristics of these symptoms was assessed in terms of the magnitude and the extent of the attack required to achieve a maximum impact on the number of components, average path length, and connectivity. Only moderate evidence was obtained to sustain the hypothesis that central and bridge symptoms constitute preferential treatment targets. The results suggest that the degree, strength, and bridgeness attack conditions are more effective than the random attack condition only in increasing the number of components of the psychopathological networks. The degree attack condition seemed to perform better than the strength, bridgeness, and overlap attack conditions. Overlapping symptoms evidenced limited impact on the psychopathological networks. The need to address the basic mechanisms underlying the structure and dynamics of psychopathological networks through the expansion of the current methodological framework and its consolidation in more robust theories is stressed.},

Their consistency is established, in particular allowing the number of covariates to increase to infinity with the sample size. Their performance in various situations is evaluated by simulation studies. It is demonstrated that the extended Bayesian information criteria incur a small loss in the positive selection rate but tightly control the false discovery rate, a desirable property in many applications. The extended Bayesian information criteria are extremely useful for variable selection in problems with a moderate sample size but with a huge number of covariates, especially in genome-wide association studies, which are now an active area in genetics research.},

The high dimensionality of the feature space causes serious difficulties: (i) the sample correlations between features become high even if the features are stochastically independent; (ii) the computation becomes intractable. These difficulties make conventional approaches either inapplicable or inefficient. The reduction of dimensionality of the feature space followed by low dimensional approaches appears the only feasible way to tackle the problem. Along this line, we develop in this article a tournament screening cum EBIC approach for feature selection with high dimensional feature space. The procedure of tournament screening mimics that of a tournament. It is shown theoretically that the tournament screening has the sure screening property, a necessary property which should be satisfied by any valid screening procedure. It is demonstrated by numerical studies that the tournament screening cum EBIC approach enjoys desirable properties such as having higher positive selection rate and lower false discovery rate than other approaches.},

  title = {A {{Bayesian}} Credible Set for Ranking Parameters by Relative Magnitude},
  author = {Chumbley, Justin},
  pages = {29},
  abstract = {The relative magnitude or ranking of statistical parameters - say treatment effects or variance components - is often more interesting or trustworthy than their absolute magnitude, or than strawman tests of their equality. Yet despite some existing tools for model selection, there is currently nothing akin to a simple {$\beta\%$} confidence or credible interval for ranking parameters of interest. We therefore aim here to automatically identify the probable ranking of (an interesting subset of) components of a parameter vector or matrix: to find the most informative or finest assertion about this ranking at the desired {$\beta\%$} credibility. For example, we may learn from linear regression on a given dataset that ``w2 {$<$} w1, w3 {$<$} w4 holds with 95\% probability'', so our 4 coefficients of interest contain at least r = 3 distinct ranks.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Network analysis (NA) is an analytical tool that allows one to explore the map of connections and eventual dynamic influences among symptoms and other elements of mental disorders. In recent years, the use of NA in psychopathology has rapidly grown, which calls for a systematic and critical analysis of its clinical utility.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of published empirical studies applying NA in psychopathology, between 2010 and 2017, was conducted. We included the literature published in PubMed and PsycINFO using as keywords any combination of "network analysis" with the terms "anxiety," "affective disorders," "depression," "schizophrenia," "psychosis," "personality disorders," "substance abuse" and "psychopathology."
RESULTS: The review showed that NA has been applied in a plethora of mental disorders in adults (i.e., 13 studies on anxiety disorders; 19 on mood disorders; 7 on psychosis; 1 on substance abuse; 1 on borderline personality disorder; 18 on the association of symptoms between disorders), and 6 on childhood and adolescence.
CONCLUSIONS: A critical examination of the results of each study suggests that NA helps to identify, in an innovative way, important aspects of psychopathology like the centrality of the symptoms in a given disorder as well as the mutual dynamics among symptoms. Yet, despite these promising results, the clinical utility of NA is still uncertain as there are important limitations on the analytic procedures (e.g., reliability of indices), the type of data included (e.g., typically restricted to secondary analysis of already published data), and ultimately, the psychometric and clinical validity of the results.},

              The pivotal problem of comorbidity research lies in the psychometric foundation it rests on, that is,
              latent variable theory
              , in which a mental disorder is viewed as a latent variable that
              causes
              a constellation of symptoms. From this perspective, comorbidity is a (bi)directional relationship between multiple latent variables. We argue that such a latent variable perspective encounters serious problems in the study of comorbidity, and offer a radically different conceptualization in terms of a
              network approach
              , where comorbidity is hypothesized to arise from direct relations between symptoms of multiple disorders. We propose a method to visualize comorbidity networks and, based on an empirical network for major depression and generalized anxiety, we argue that this approach generates realistic hypotheses about pathways to comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and diagnostic boundaries, that are not naturally accommodated by latent variable models: Some pathways to comorbidity through the
              symptom space
              are more likely than others; those pathways generally have the same direction (i.e., from symptoms of one disorder to symptoms of the other); overlapping symptoms play an important role in comorbidity; and boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily fuzzy.},

In this view, responses to extraversion items correlate because they measure the same latent dimension. In this paper, we challenge this way of thinking and offer an alternative perspective on personality as a system of connected affective, cognitive and behavioural components. We hypothesize that these components do not hang together because they measure the same underlying dimension; they do so because they depend on one another directly for causal, homeostatic or logical reasons (e.g. if one does not like people and it is harder to enjoy parties). From this `network perspective', personality dimensions emerge out of the connectivity structure that exists between the various components of personality. After outlining the network theory, we illustrate how it applies to personality research in four domains: (i) the overall organization of personality components; (ii) the distinction between state and trait; (iii) the genetic architecture of personality; and (iv) the relation between personality and psychopathology.

Are mental disorders analogous to tumors, in that they exist as separate entities somewhere in people's minds? Do mental disorders cause symptoms such as insomnia and fatigue? Until very recently, it was exactly this sort of thinking that (implicitly) permeated many, if not all, research paradigms in clinical psychology and psychiatry. However, in recent years, a novel approach has been advocated (i.e., the network perspective), in which mental disorders are not conceived of as entities that have a separate existence from their respective symptoms. Instead, mental disorders are hypothesized to be networks of symptoms that directly influence one another. So, for example, from a network perspective, insomnia and fatigue are not caused by the same underlying disorder (i.e., major depression) but causally influence one another (i.e., insomnia \textrightarrow{} fatigue). A disorder, then, develops because of such direct relations between symptoms in which positive feedback mechanisms (i.e., vicious circles) are present: for example, insomnia \textrightarrow{} fatigue \textrightarrow{} feelings of guilt \textrightarrow{} insomnia. These feedback mechanisms may propel the aggravation of one's condition and make a person end up in, for example, a full-fledged depressive episode. In this contribution, we elaborate on network perspectives on the nature of mental disorders as well as their implications for our outlook on diagnosis and comorbidity.},

These models marry graph and probability theory to visualize, understand, and interpret variables and their relations as nodes and edges in a graph. Many applications of network models rely on undirected graphs in which the absence of an edge between two nodes encodes conditional independence between the corresponding variables. To gauge the importance of nodes in such a network, various node centrality measures have become widely used, especially in psychology and neuroscience. It is intuitive to interpret nodes with high centrality measures as being important in a causal sense. Using the causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that the relation between causal influence and node centrality measures is not straightforward. In particular, the correlation between causal influence and several node centrality measures is weak, except for eigenvector centrality. Our results provide a cautionary tale: if the underlying real-world system can be modeled as a DAG, but researchers interpret nodes with high centrality as causally important, then this may result in sub-optimal interventions.},

A reason for this is that significance levels or confidence intervals are often applied to secondary variables or sub-samples within the trial, in addition to the primary hypotheses (multiple hypotheses). This problem is likely to be extensive for population-based surveys, in which epidemiological hypotheses are derived after seeing the data set (hypothesis fishing). We recommend a data-splitting procedure to counteract this methodological problem, in which one part of the data set is used for identifying hypotheses, and the other is used for hypothesis testing. The procedure is similar to two-stage analysis of microarray data. We illustrate the process using a real data set related to predictors of low back pain at 14-year follow-up in a population initially free of low back pain. ``Widespreadness'' of pain (pain reported in several other places than the low back) was a statistically significant predictor, while smoking was not, despite its strong association with low back pain in the first half of the data set. We argue that the application of data splitting, in which an independent party handles the data set, will achieve for epidemiological surveys what pre-registration has done for clinical studies.},

Often, their multivariate structure is either ignored or treated as a nuisance. This study aims to lift this limitation by applying network analysis to explicate the multivariate pattern of risk and success factors for subjective well-being in autism spectrum disorder. We estimated a network structure for 27 potential factors in 2341 individuals with autism spectrum disorder to assess the centrality of specific life domains and their importance for well-being. The data included both self- and proxy-reported information. We identified social satisfaction and societal contribution as the strongest direct paths to subjective well-being. The results suggest that an important contribution to well-being lies in resources that allow the individual to engage in social relations, which influence well-being directly. Factors most important in determining the network?s structure include self-reported IQ, living situation, level of daily activity, and happiness. Number of family members with autism spectrum disorder and openness about one?s diagnosis are least important of all factors for subjective well-being. These types of results can serve as a roadmap for interventions directed at improving the well-being of individuals with autism spectrum disorder.},

For a k-level predictor, one typically uses either a k - 1 degree of freedom (df) test or a single df trend test, which requires scores for the different levels of the predictor. In the absence of knowledge of a parametric form for the response function, one can incorporate monotonicity constraints to improve the efficiency of tests of association. This article proposes a general Bayesian approach for inference on order-constrained parameters in generalized linear models. Instead of choosing a prior distribution with support on the constrained space, which can result in major computational difficulties, we propose to map draws from an unconstrained posterior density using an isotonic regression transformation. This approach allows flat regions over which increases in the level of a predictor have no effect. Bayes factors for assessing ordered trends can be computed based on the output from a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Results from a simulation study are presented and the approach is applied to data from a time-to-pregnancy study.},

  abstract = {In management research, theory testing confronts a paradox described by Meehl in which designing studies with greater methodological rigor puts theories at less risk of falsification. This paradox exists because most management theories make predictions that are merely directional, such as stating that two variables will be positively or negatively related. As methodological rigor increases, the probability that an estimated effect will differ from zero likewise increases, and the likelihood of finding support for a directional prediction boils down to a coin toss. This paradox can be resolved by developing theories with greater precision, such that their propositions predict something more meaningful than deviations from zero. This article evaluates the precision of theories in management research, offers guidelines for making theories more precise, and discusses ways to overcome barriers to the pursuit of theoretical precision.},

  abstract = {High-dimensional data from molecular biology possess an intricate correlation structure that is imposed by the molecular interactions between genes and their products forming various different types of gene networks. This fact is particularly well known for gene expression data, because there is a sufficient number of large-scale data sets available that are amenable for a sensible statistical analysis confirming this assertion. The purpose of this paper is two fold. First, we investigate three methods for generating constrained covariance matrices with a biologically realistic structure. Such covariance matrices are playing a pivotal role in designing novel statistical methods for high-dimensional biological data, because they allow to define Gaussian graphical models (GGM) for the simulation of realistic data; including their correlation structure. We study local and global characteristics of these covariance matrices, and derived concentration/partial correlation matrices. Second, we connect these results, obtained from a probabilistic perspective, to statistical results of studies aiming to estimate gene regulatory networks from biological data. This connection allows to shed light on the well-known heterogeneity of statistical estimation methods for inferring gene regulatory networks and provides an explanation for the difficulties inferring molecular interactions between highly connected genes.},

  abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize behavior as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various research fields. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

  abstract = {We introduce the network model as a formal psychometric model, conceptualizing the covariance between psychometric indicators as resulting from pairwise interactions between observable variables in a network structure. This contrasts with standard psychometric models, in which the covariance between test items arises from the influence of one or more common latent variables. Here, we present two generalizations of the network model that encompass latent variable structures, establishing network modeling as parts of the more general framework of structural equation modeling (SEM). In the first generalization, we model the covariance structure of latent variables as a network. We term this framework latent network modeling (LNM) and show that, with LNM, a unique structure of conditional independence relationships between latent variables can be obtained in an explorative manner. In the second generalization, the residual variance\textendash{}covariance structure of indicators is modeled as a network. We term this generalization residual network modeling (RNM) and show that, within this framework, identifiable models can be obtained in which local independence is structurally violated. These generalizations allow for a general modeling framework that can be used to fit, and compare, SEM models, network models, and the RNM and LNM generalizations. This methodology has been implemented in the free-to-use software package lvnet, which contains confirmatory model testing as well as two exploratory search algorithms: stepwise search algorithms for low-dimensional datasets and penalized maximum likelihood estimation for larger datasets. We show in simulation studies that these search algorithms perform adequately in identifying the structure of the relevant residual or latent networks. We further demonstrate the utility of these generalizations in an empirical example on a personality inventory dataset.},

The Ising model is a model used in ferromagnetism to explain phase transitions in a field of particles. Following the description of the Ising model in statistical physics, the chapter continues to show that the Ising model is closely related to models used in psychometrics. The Ising model can be shown to be equivalent to certain kinds of logistic regression models, loglinear models and multi-dimensional item response theory (MIRT) models. The equivalence between the Ising model and the MIRT model puts standard psychometrics in a new light and leads to a strikingly different interpretation of well-known latent variable models. The chapter gives an overview of methods that can be used to estimate the Ising model, and concludes with a discussion on the interpretation of latent variables given the equivalence between the Ising model and MIRT.},

We asked whether variability in initial acquisition and of improvement in performance on a demanding video game, the Space Fortress game, could be predicted by variations in the pretraining volume of either of 2 key brain regions implicated in learning and memory: the striatum, implicated in procedural learning and cognitive flexibility, and the hippocampus, implicated in declarative memory. We found that hippocampal volumes did not predict learning improvement but that striatal volumes did. Moreover, for the striatum, the volumes of the dorsal striatum predicted improvement in performance but the volumes of the ventral striatum did not. Both ventral and dorsal striatal volumes predicted early acquisition rates. Furthermore, this early-stage correlation between striatal volumes and learning held regardless of the cognitive flexibility demands of the game versions, whereas the predictive power of the dorsal striatal volumes held selectively for performance improvements in a game version emphasizing cognitive flexibility. These findings suggest a neuroanatomical basis for the superiority of training strategies that promote cognitive flexibility and transfer to untrained tasks.},

In the case of hypothesis testing, it is of the greatest importance that the researcher specify exactly what is meant by a ``null'' hypothesis as well as the alternative to which it is contrasted, and that these are suitable instantiations of theoretical positions. Here, we provide an overview of different instantiations of null and alternative hypotheses that can be useful in practice, but in all cases the inferential procedure is based on the same underlying method of likelihood comparison.

The validity of conclusions drawn from these studies clearly depends on the range of distributions obtainable with the VM method. We deduce the distribution and the copula for a vector generated by a generalized VM transformation, and show that it is fundamentally linked to the underlying Gaussian distribution and copula. In the process we derive the distribution of the Fleishman polynomial in full generality. While data generated with the VM approach appears to be highly non-normal, its truly multivariate properties are close to the Gaussian case. A Monte Carlo study illustrates that generating data with a different copula than that implied by the VM approach severely weakens the performance of normal-theory based ML estimates.},

To date, 4 main types of psychopathology networks have been proposed: (a) association networks, (b) regularized concentration networks, (c) relative importance networks, and (d) directed acyclic graphs. The authors examined the replicability of these analyses based on symptoms of major depression and generalized anxiety between and within 2 highly similar epidemiological samples (i.e., the National Comorbidity Survey\textemdash{}Replication [n = 9282] and the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing [n = 8841]). Although association networks were stable, the 3 other types of network analysis (i.e., the conditional independence networks) had poor replicability between and within methods and samples. The detailed aspects of the models\textemdash{}such as the estimation of specific edges and the centrality of individual nodes\textemdash{}were particularly unstable. For example, 44\% of the symptoms were estimated as the ``most influential'' on at least 1 centrality index across the 6 conditional independence networks in the full samples, and only 13\textendash{}21\% of the edges were consistently estimated across these networks. One of the likely reasons for the instability of the networks is the predominance of measurement error in the assessment of individual symptoms. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for the growing field of psychopathology network research, and conclude that novel results originating from psychopathology networks should be held to higher standards of evidence before they are ready for dissemination or implementation in the field.

We compared GGMs of depression and anxiety symptoms in two waves of data from an observational study (n = 403) and reanalyzed four posttraumatic stress disorder GGMs from a recent study of network replicability. Taken on face value, the existing suite of methods indicated that overall the network edges were stable, interpretable, and consistent between networks, but the direct metrics of replication indicated that this was not the case (e.g., 39\textendash{}49\% of the edges in each network were unreplicated across the pairwise comparisons). We discuss reasons for these apparently contradictory results (e.g., relying on global summary statistics versus examining the detailed characteristics interpreted in the literature) and conclude that the limited reliability of the detailed characteristics of networks observed here is likely to be common in practice, but overlooked by current methods. Poor replicability underpins our concern surrounding the use of these methods, given that generalizable conclusions are fundamental to the utility of their results.},

  abstract = {A set of features is the basis for the network representation of proximity data achieved by feature network models (FNMs). Features are binary variables that characterize the objects in an experiment, with some measure of proximity as response variable. Sometimes features are provided by theory and play an important role in the construction of the experimental conditions. In some research settings, the features are not known a priori. This paper shows how to generate features in this situation and how to select an adequate subset of features that takes into account a good compromise between model fit and model complexity, using a new version of least angle regression that restricts coefficients to be non-negative, called the Positive Lasso. It will be shown that features can be generated efficiently with Gray codes that are naturally linked to the FNMs. The model selection strategy makes use of the fact that FNM can be considered as univariate multiple regression model. A simulation study shows that the proposed strategy leads to satisfactory results if the number of objects is less than or equal to 22. If the number of objects is larger than 22, the number of features selected by our method exceeds the true number of features in some conditions.},

They include abilities such as response inhibition, interference control, working memory updating, and set shifting. EFs show a general pattern of shared but distinct functions, a pattern described as ``unity and diversity.'' We review studies of EF unity and diversity at the behavioral and genetic levels, focusing on studies of normal individual differences and what they reveal about the functional organization of these cognitive abilities. In particular, we review evidence that across multiple ages and populations, commonly studied EFs (a) are robustly correlated but separable when measured with latent variables; (b) are not the same as general intelligence or g; (c) are highly heritable at the latent level and seemingly also highly polygenic; and (d) activate both common and specific neural areas and can be linked to individual differences in neural activation, volume, and connectivity. We highlight how considering individual differences at the behavioral and neural levels can add considerable insight to the investigation of the functional organization of the brain, and conclude with some key points about individual differences to consider when interpreting neuropsychological patterns of dissociation.},

To overcome these limitations, the present cross-cultural multisite study estimated regularized partial correlation networks of 16 PTSD symptoms across four data sets of traumatized patients receiving treatment for PTSD (total N = 2,782). Despite differences in culture, trauma type, and severity of the samples, considerable similarities emerged, with moderate to high correlations between symptom profiles (0.43\textendash{}0.82), network structures (0.62\textendash{}0.74), and centrality estimates (0.63\textendash{}0.75).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The symptoms for Major Depression (MD) defined in the DSM-5 differ markedly from symptoms assessed in common rating scales, and the empirical question about core depression symptoms is unresolved. Here we conceptualize depression as a complex dynamic system of interacting symptoms to examine what symptoms are most central to driving depressive processes.
METHODS: We constructed a network of 28 depression symptoms assessed via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-30) in 3,463 depressed outpatients from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. We estimated the centrality of all IDS-30 symptoms, and compared the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms; centrality reflects the connectedness of each symptom with all other symptoms.
RESULTS: A network with 28 intertwined symptoms emerged, and symptoms differed substantially in their centrality values. Both DSM symptoms (e.g., sad mood) and non-DSM symptoms (e.g., anxiety) were among the most central symptoms, and DSM criteria were not more central than non-DSM symptoms.
LIMITATIONS: Many subjects enrolled in STAR*D reported comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions which may have affected symptom presentation.
CONCLUSION: The network perspective neither supports the standard psychometric notion that depression symptoms are equivalent indicators of MD, nor the common assumption that DSM symptoms of depression are of higher clinical relevance than non-DSM depression symptoms. The findings suggest the value of research focusing on especially central symptoms to increase the accuracy of predicting outcomes such as the course of illness, probability of relapse, and treatment response.},

Intraindividual variability was found to be stable across time and correlated across tasks at each testing occasion. Intraindividual variability also uniquely differentiated the groups.

Classical latent state-trait (LST) models are designed to measure reversible state variability around a fixed set-point or trait, whereas latent growth curve (LGC) models focus on long-lasting and often irreversible trait changes. In the present paper, we contrast LST and LGC models from the perspective of measurement invariance (MI) testing. We show that establishing a pure state-variability process requires (a) the inclusion of a mean structure and (b) establishing strong factorial invariance in LST analyses. Analytical derivations and simulations demonstrate that LST models with non-invariant parameters can mask the fact that a trait-change or hybrid process has generated the data. Furthermore, the inappropriate application of LST models to trait change or hybrid data can lead to bias in the estimates of consistency and occasion-specificity, which are typically of key interest in LST analyses. Four tips for the proper application of LST models are provided.},

  abstract = {Constrained parameter problems arise in a wide variety of applications, including bioassay, actuarial graduation, ordinal categorical
data, response surfaces, reliability development testing, and variance component models. Truncated data problems arise naturally
in survival and failure time studies, ordinal data models, and categorical data studies aimed at uncovering underlying continuous
distributions. In many applications both parameter constraints and data truncation are present. The statistical literature on such
problems is very extensive, reflecting both the problems' widespread occurrence in applications and the methodological challenges
that they pose. However, it is striking that so little of this applied and theoretical literature involves a parametric Bayesian perspective.
From a technical viewpoint, this perhaps is not difficult to understand. The fundamental tool for Bayesian calculations in typical
realistic models is(multidimensional) numerical integration, which often is problematic in unconstrained contexts and can be wellnigh impossible for the kinds of constrained problems we consider. In this article we show that Bayesiancalculations canbe implemented
routinely for constrained parameter and truncated data problems by means of the Gibbs sampler. Specific models discussed include
constrained multinorrnal parameters, constrained linear model parameters, ordered parameters in experimental family models, data
and order restricted parameters from exponential distributions, straight line regression with censoring and bivariate grouped data
models. Analysis of data sets illustrating the first two of these settings is provided.},

  abstract = {Explained variance (R2) is a familiar summary of the fit of a linear regression and has been generalized in various ways to multilevel (hierarchical) models. The multilevel models that we consider in this article are characterized by hierarchical data structures in which individuals are grouped into units (which themselves might be further grouped into larger units), and variables are measured on individuals and each grouping unit. The models are based on regression relationships at different levels, with the first level corresponding to the individual data and subsequent levels corresponding to between-group regressions of individual predictor effects on grouping unit variables. We present an approach to defining R2 at each level of the multilevel model, rather than attempting to create a single summary measure of fit. Our method is based on comparing variances in a single fitted model rather than with a null model. In simple regression, our measure generalizes the classical adjusted R2. We also discuss a related variance comparison to summarize the degree to which estimates at each level of the model are pooled together based on the level-specific regression relationship, rather than estimated separately. This pooling factor is related to the concept of shrinkage in simple hierarchical models. We illustrate the methods on a dataset of radon in houses within counties using a series of models ranging from a simple linear regression model to a multilevel varying-intercept, varying-slope model.},

Previous attempts to identify elementary syndromes have shown limitations that have slowed progress in the taxonomy of psychiatric disorders. Aim: To examine the ability of network community detection (NCD) to identify elementary syndromes of psychopathology and move beyond the limitations of current classification methods in psychiatry.
Methods: 192 patients with unselected mental disorders were tested on the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the bootstrapped correlation matrix of symptom scores to extract the principal component structure (PCS). An undirected and weighted network graph was constructed from the same matrix. Network community structure (NCS) was optimized using a previously published technique.
Results: In the optimal network structure, network clusters showed a 89\% match with principal components of psychopathology. Some 6 network clusters were found, including "DEPRESSION", "MANIA", ``ANXIETY'', "PSYCHOSIS", "RETARDATION", and "BEHAVIORAL DISORGANIZATION". Network metrics were used to quantify the continuities between the elementary syndromes.
Conclusion: We present the first comprehensive network graph of psychopathology that is free from the biases of previous classifications: a `Psychopathology Web'. Clusters within this network represent elementary syndromes that are connected via a limited number of bridge symptoms. Many},

  abstract = {The estimation of the correct number of dimensions is a long-standing problem in psychometrics. Several methods have been proposed, such as parallel analysis (PA), Kaiser-Guttman's eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule, multiple average partial procedure (MAP), the maximum-likelihood approaches that use fit indexes as BIC and EBIC and the less used and studied approach called very simple structure (VSS). In the present paper a new approach to estimate the number of dimensions will be introduced and compared via simulation to the traditional techniques pointed above. The approach proposed in the current paper is called exploratory graph analysis (EGA), since it is based on the graphical lasso with the regularization parameter specified using EBIC. The number of dimensions is verified using the walktrap, a random walk algorithm used to identify communities in networks. In total, 32,000 data sets were simulated to fit known factor structures, with the data sets varying across different criteria: number of factors (2 and 4), number of items (5 and 10), sample size (100, 500, 1000 and 5000) and correlation between factors (orthogonal, .20, .50 and .70), resulting in 64 different conditions. For each condition, 500 data sets were simulated using lavaan. The result shows that the EGA performs comparable to parallel analysis, EBIC, eBIC and to Kaiser-Guttman rule in a number of situations, especially when the number of factors was two. However, EGA was the only technique able to correctly estimate the number of dimensions in the four-factor structure when the correlation between factors were .7, showing an accuracy of 100\% for a sample size of 5,000 observations. Finally, the EGA was used to estimate the number of factors in a real dataset, in order to compare its performance with the other six techniques tested in the simulation study.},

The sample comprised 686 Portuguese children (381 girls) aged 9\textendash{}11 years, from 23 schools. Sedentary time was estimated by the Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer, which was used 24 hours/day for 7 consecutive days; height, sitting height, and weight were measured, BMI was computed (WHO cut-points were used to classify subjects as normal weight or overweight/obese), and maturity offset was estimated. Information regarding the home environment was obtained by questionnaire. Results revealed that (i) children were more sedentary on Friday, but less so on Saturday and Sunday (compared to Monday), with significant variation between- and within-subjects (between-subject variance=0.800, within-subject variance=1.793, intra-subject correlation=0.308); (ii) there is a sex effect on sedentariness, with boys being less sedentary than girls (p{$<$}0.001), and the between-subject variance was 1.48 times larger for boys than girls; (iii) in terms of the within-subject variance, or erraticism, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday have similar erraticism levels as Monday (Thursday has less, while Saturday and Sunday have more); in addition, girls (variance ratio=0.632, p{$<$}0.001), overweight/obese children (variance ratio=0.861, p=0.019), and those later mature (variance ratio=0.849, p=0.013) have less erraticism than their counterparts; (iv) the within-subject variance varied significantly across subjects (scale std dev=0.342{$\pm$}0.037, p{$<$}0.001); and (v) in the fixed part of the model, only biological maturation was positively related to sedentariness. This study demonstrated that there is significant between- and within-subject variability in sedentariness across a whole week. This implies that a focus on intra-individual variability, instead of only on mean values, would provide relevant information towards a more complete map of children's sedentary behaviour, which can be helpful when developing more efficient strategies to reduce sedentariness.},

In the Bayesian framework, the evaluation of informative hypotheses often makes use of default Bayes factors such as the fractional Bayes factor. This paper approximates and adjusts the fractional Bayes factor such that it can be used to evaluate informative hypotheses in general statistical models. In the fractional Bayes factor a fraction parameter must be specified which controls the amount of information in the data used for specifying an implicit prior. The remaining fraction is used for testing the informative hypotheses. We discuss different choices of this parameter and present a scheme for setting it. Furthermore, a software package is described which computes the approximated adjusted fractional Bayes factor. Using this software package, psychological researchers can evaluate informative hypotheses by means of Bayes factors in an easy manner. Two empirical examples are used to illustrate the procedure.},

Here we develop a set of nested models that account for order restrictions across individuals in psychological tasks. An order-restricted model addresses the question ``Does everybody,'' as in ``Does everybody show the usual Stroop effect,'' or ``Does everybody respond more quickly to intense noises than subtle ones?'' The crux of the modeling is the instantiation of 10s or 100s of order restrictions simultaneously, one for each participant. To our knowledge, the problem is intractable in frequentist contexts but relatively straightforward in Bayesian ones. We develop a Bayes factor model-comparison strategy using Zellner and Siow's default g-priors appropriate for assessing whether effects obey equality and order restrictions. We apply the methodology to seven data sets from Stroop, Simon, and Eriksen interference tasks. Not too surprisingly, we find that everybody Stroops\textemdash{}that is, for all people congruent colors are truly named more quickly than incongruent ones. But, perhaps surprisingly, we find these order constraints are violated for some people in the Simon task, that is, for these people spatially incongruent responses occur truly more quickly than congruent ones!

It is sometimes the case that an investigator is studying a population exposed to two agents, X and Y, where Y is the agent of primary interest. Previous research may suggest that the exposures have different effects on the health outcome of interest, one being more harmful than the other. Such information may be derived from epidemiologic analyses; however, in the case where such evidence is unavailable, knowledge can be drawn from toxicologic studies or other experimental research. Unfortunately, using toxicologic findings to develop informative priors in epidemiologic analyses requires strong assumptions, with no established method for its utilization. We present a method to help bridge the gap between animal and cellular studies and epidemiologic research by specification of an order-constrained prior. We illustrate this approach using an example from radiation epidemiology.},

In this paper, we investigate how to best make use of this growing body of empirical research and move the field toward its fundamental aims of explaining, predicting, and controlling psychopathology. We first review the contemporary philosophy of science literature on scientific theories and argue that fully achieving the aims of explanation, prediction, and control requires that we construct formal theories of mental disorders: theories expressed in the language of mathematics or a computational programming language. We then investigate three routes by which one can use empirical findings (i.e., data models) to construct formal theories: (a) using data models themselves as formal theories, (b) using data models to infer formal theories, and (c) comparing empirical data models to theory-implied data models in order to evaluate and refine an existing formal theory. We argue that the third approach is the most promising path forward and conclude by expanding on this approach, proposing a framework for theory construction that details how to best use empirical research to generate, develop, and test formal theories of mental disorders.},

In regression analysis, this includes the important scenario of testing whether one or more of the covariates have an effect on the dependent variable. However, the Savage\textendash{}Dickey ratio only provides the correct Bayes factor if the prior distribution of the nuisance parameters under the nested model is identical to the conditional prior under the full model given the equality constraint. This condition is violated for multiple regression models with a Jeffreys\textendash{}Zellner\textendash{}Siow prior, which is often used as a default prior in psychology. Besides linear regression models, the limitation of the Savage\textendash{}Dickey ratio is especially relevant when analytical solutions for the Bayes factor are not available. This is the case for generalized linear models, non-linear models, or cognitive process models with regression extensions. As a remedy, the correct Bayes factor can be computed using a generalized version of the Savage\textendash{}Dickey density ratio.},

The error variance and the variance of the random effects are usually considered to be homogeneous. These variance terms characterize the within-subjects (i.e., error variance) and between-subjects (i.e., random-effects variance) variation in the data. In studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), up to 30 or 40 observations are often obtained for each subject, and interest frequently centers around changes in the variances, both within and between subjects. In this article, we focus on an adolescent smoking study using EMA where interest is on characterizing changes in mood variation. We describe how covariates can influence the mood variances, and also extend the standard mixed model by adding a subject-level random effect to the within-subject variance specification. This permits subjects to have influence on the mean, or location, and variability, or (square of the) scale, of their mood responses. Additionally, we allow the location and scale random effects to be correlated. These mixed-effects location scale models have useful applications in many research areas where interest centers on the joint modeling of the mean and variance structure.},

For such questionnaires, item response theory (IRT) models provide a useful approach for obtaining summary scores for subjects (i.e., the model's random subject effect) and characteristics of the items (e.g., item difficulty and discrimination). In this article, we describe a model that allows the items to additionally exhibit different within-subject variance, and also includes a subject-level random effect to the within-subject variance specification. This permits subjects to be characterized in terms of their mean level, or location, and their variability, or scale, and the model allows item difficulty and discrimination in terms of both random subject effects (location and scale). We illustrate application of this location-scale mixed model using data from the Social Subscale of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire assessed in an adolescent study. We show that the proposed model fits the data significantly better than simpler IRT models, and is able to identify items and subjects that are not well-fit by the simpler models. The proposed model has useful applications in many areas where questionnaires are often rated on an ordinal scale, and there is interest in characterizing subjects in terms of both their mean and variability.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{\textbackslash{}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{\textbackslash{}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

  abstract = {Learning about hypothesis evaluation using the Bayes factor could enhance psychological research. In contrast to null-hypothesis significance testing it renders the evidence in favor of each of the hypotheses under consideration (it can be used to quantify support for the null-hypothesis) instead of a dichotomous reject/do-not-reject decision; it can straightforwardly be used for the evaluation of multiple hypotheses without having to bother about the proper manner to account for multiple testing; and it allows continuous reevaluation of hypotheses after additional data have been collected (Bayesian updating). This tutorial addresses researchers considering to evaluate their hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor. The focus is completely applied and each topic discussed is illustrated using Bayes factors for the evaluation of hypotheses in the context of an ANOVA model, obtained using the R package bain. Readers can execute all the analyses presented while reading this tutorial if they download bain and the R-codes used.

Translational Abstract\textemdash{}Learning about hypothesis evaluation using the Bayes factor could enhance psychological research. The Bayes factor quantifies the support in the data for two competing hypotheses. These may be the traditional null and alternative hypotheses, but these may also be informative hypotheses like m1 \&gt; m2 \&gt; m3 and (m1 - m2) \&gt; (m2 - m3) where m1, m2, and m3 denote the means in three experimental groups. Bayesian hypotheses evaluation offers options such as quantifying evidence in favor of the null-hypothesis, simultaneous evaluation of multiple hypotheses, and Bayesian updating, that is, recomputation of the Bayes factor after additional data have been collected. In this tutorial it is elaborated how researchers can use the Bayes factor for the analysis of their own data. The focus is completely applied and each topic discussed is illustrated using Bayes factors for the evaluation of hypotheses in the context of an ANOVA model, obtained using the R package bain. Readers can execute all the analyses presented while reading this tutorial if they download bain and the R-codes used from the bain website.

  abstract = {Background
Individuals in remission from depression are at increased risk for developing future depressive episodes. Several cognitive risk- and resilience factors have been suggested to account for this vulnerability. In the current study we explored how risk- and protective factors such as cognitive control, adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation, residual symptomatology, and resilience relate to one another in a remitted depressed (RMD) sample.
Methods
We examined the relationships between these constructs in a cross-sectional dataset of 69 RMD patients using network analyses in order to obtain a comprehensive, data-driven view on the interplay between these constructs. We subsequently present an association network, a concentration network, and a relative importance network.
Results
In all three networks resilience formed the central hub, connecting perceived cognitive control (i.e., working memory complaints), emotion regulation, and residual symptomatology. The contribution of the behavioral measure for cognitive control in the network was negligible. Moreover, the directed relative importance network indicates bidirectional influences between these constructs, with all indicators of centrality suggesting a key role of resilience in remission from depression.
Limitations
The presented findings are cross-sectional and networks are limited to a fixed set of key constructs in the literature pertaining cognitive vulnerability for depression.
Conclusions
These findings indicate the importance of resilience to successfully cope with stressors following remission from depression. Further in-depth studies will be essential to identify the specific underlying resilience mechanisms that may be key to successful remission from depression.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of selecting a portfolio of entries of fixed cardinality for a winner take all contest such that the probability of at least one entry winning is maximized. This framework is very general and can be used to model a variety of problems, such as movie studios selecting movies to produce, drug companies choosing drugs to develop, or venture capital firms picking start-up companies in which to invest. We model this as a combinatorial optimization problem with a submodular objective function, which is the probability of winning. We then show that the objective function can be approximated using only pairwise marginal probabilities of the entries winning when there is a certain structure on their joint distribution. We consider a model where the entries are jointly Gaussian random variables and present a closed form approximation to the objective function. We then consider a model where the entries are given by sums of constrained resources and present a greedy integer programming formulation to construct the entries. Our formulation uses three principles to construct entries: maximize the expected score of an entry, lower bound its variance, and upper bound its correlation with previously constructed entries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our greedy integer programming formulation, we apply it to daily fantasy sports contests that have top heavy payoff structures (i.e. most of the winnings go to the top ranked entries). We find that the entries produced by our approach perform well in practice and are even able to come in first place in contests with thousands of entries. Our approach can easily be extended to other problems with a winner take all type of payoff structure.},

A model selection criterion, called the ICQ statistic, is proposed for selecting the penalty parameters (Ibrahim, Zhu, and Tang, 2008, Journal of the American Statistical Association 103, 1648\textendash{}1658). The variable selection procedure based on ICQ is shown to consistently select important fixed and random effects.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research., Published research findings are sometimes refuted by subsequent evidence, says Ioannidis, with ensuing confusion and disappointment.},

  abstract = {Recently, researchers in clinical psychology have endeavored to create network models of the relationships between symptoms, both within and across mental disorders. Symptoms that connect two mental disorders are called "bridge symptoms." Unfortunately, no formal quantitative methods for identifying these bridge symptoms exist. Accordingly, we developed four network statistics to identify bridge symptoms: bridge strength, bridge betweenness, bridge closeness, and bridge expected influence. These statistics are nonspecific to the type of network estimated, making them potentially useful in individual-level psychometric networks, group-level psychometric networks, and networks outside the field of psychopathology such as social networks. We first tested the fidelity of our statistics in predicting bridge nodes in a series of simulations. Averaged across all conditions, the statistics achieved a sensitivity of 92.7\% and a specificity of 84.9\%. By simulating datasets of varying sample sizes, we tested the robustness of our statistics, confirming their suitability for network psychometrics. Furthermore, we simulated the contagion of one mental disorder to another, showing that deactivating bridge nodes prevents the spread of comorbidity (i.e., one disorder activating another). Eliminating nodes based on bridge statistics was more effective than eliminating nodes high on traditional centrality statistics in preventing comorbidity. Finally, we applied our algorithms to 18 group-level empirical comorbidity networks from published studies and discussed the implications of this analysis.},

  abstract = {Throughout social and cognitive psychology, participants are routinely asked to respond in some way to experimental stimuli that are thought to represent categories of theoretical interest. For instance, in measures of implicit attitudes, participants are primed with pictures of specific African American and White stimulus persons sampled in some way from possible stimuli that might have been used. Yet seldom is the sampling of stimuli taken into account in the analysis of the resulting data, in spite of numerous warnings about the perils of ignoring stimulus variation (Clark, 1973; Kenny, 1985; Wells \& Windschitl, 1999). Part of this failure to attend to stimulus variation is due to the demands imposed by traditional analysis of variance procedures for the analysis of data when both participants and stimuli are treated as random factors. In this article, we present a comprehensive solution using mixed models for the analysis of data with crossed random factors (e.g., participants and stimuli). We show the substantial biases inherent in analyses that ignore one or the other of the random factors, and we illustrate the substantial advantages of the mixed models approach with both hypothetical and actual, well-known data sets in social psychology (Bem, 2011; Blair, Chapleau, \& Judd, 2005; Correll, Park, Judd, \& Wittenbrink, 2002).},

The sparseness assumption is rather minimal requiring only that the neighborhoods in the DAG are of lower order than sample size n. We also demonstrate the PC-algorithm for simulated data.},

This systematic review summarized CFAs on performance-based tests of executive functions and reanalyzed summary data to identify best-fitting models. Eligible CFAs involved 46 samples (N = 9,756). The most frequently accepted models varied by age (i.e., preschool = one/two-factor; school-age = three-factor; adolescent/adult = three/nested-factor; older adult = two/three-factor), and most often included updating/working memory, inhibition, and shifting factors. A bootstrap reanalysis simulated 5,000 samples from 21 correlation matrices (11 child/adolescent; 10 adult) from studies including the three most common factors, fitting seven competing models. Model results were summarized as the mean percent accepted (i.e., average rate at which models converged and met fit thresholds: CFI {$\geq$} .90/RMSEA {$\leq$} .08) and mean percent selected (i.e., average rate at which a model showed superior fit to other models: {$\Delta$}CFI {$\geq$} .005/.010/{$\Delta$}RMSEA {$\leq$} -.010/-.015). No model consistently converged and met fit criteria in all samples. Among adult samples, the nested-factor was accepted (41\textendash{}42\%) and selected (8\textendash{}30\%) most often. Among child/adolescent samples, the unidimensional model was accepted (32\textendash{}36\%) and selected (21\textendash{}53\%) most often, with some support for two-factor models without a differentiated shifting factor. Results show some evidence for greater unidimensionality of executive function among child/adolescent samples and both unity and diversity among adult samples. However, low rates of model acceptance/selection suggest possible bias toward the publication of well-fitting but potentially nonreplicable models with underpowered samples.

  abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {$<$} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {$<$} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen's ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({$<$} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

The concept of encompassing priors is introduced, that is, a prior distribution for an unconstrained model from which the prior distributions of the constrained models can be derived.

It is also shown that, for a specific class of models, selection based on encompassing priors will render a virtually objective selection procedure.

  abstract = {Background: Graphical Gaussian models are popular tools for the estimation of (undirected) gene association networks from microarray data. A key issue when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of samples is the estimation of the matrix of partial correlations. Since the (Moore-Penrose) inverse of the sample covariance matrix leads to poor estimates in this scenario, standard methods are inappropriate and adequate regularization techniques are needed. Popular approaches include biased estimates of the covariance matrix and highdimensional regression schemes, such as the Lasso and Partial Least Squares.
Results: In this article, we investigate a general framework for combining regularized regression methods with the estimation of Graphical Gaussian models. This framework includes various existing methods as well as two new approaches based on ridge regression and adaptive lasso, respectively. These methods are extensively compared both qualitatively and quantitatively within a simulation study and through an application to six diverse real data sets. In addition, all proposed algorithms are implemented in the R package "parcor", available from the R repository CRAN.
Conclusion: In our simulation studies, the investigated non-sparse regression methods, i.e. Ridge Regression and Partial Least Squares, exhibit rather conservative behavior when combined with (local) false discovery rate multiple testing in order to decide whether or not an edge is present in the network. For networks with higher densities, the difference in performance of the methods decreases. For sparse networks, we confirm the Lasso's well known tendency towards selecting too many edges, whereas the two-stage adaptive Lasso is an interesting alternative that provides sparser solutions. In our simulations, both sparse and non-sparse methods are able to reconstruct networks with cluster structures. On six real data sets, we also clearly distinguish the results obtained using the non-sparse methods and those obtained using the sparse methods where specification of the regularization parameter automatically means model selection. In five out of six data sets, Partial Least Squares selects very dense networks. Furthermore, for data that violate the assumption of uncorrelated observations (due to replications), the Lasso and the adaptive Lasso yield very complex structures, indicating that they might not be suited under these conditions. The shrinkage approach is more stable than the regression based approaches when using subsampling.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE
While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.

MEASUREMENTS
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ``0'' (not at all) to ``3'' (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.

RESULTS
As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {$\geq$}10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.

CONCLUSION
In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

  abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with metabolomics data linked genetic variation in the human genome to differences in individual metabolite levels. A strong relevance of this metabolic individuality for biomedical and pharmaceutical research has been reported. However, a considerable amount of the molecules currently quantified by modern metabolomics techniques are chemically unidentified. The identification of these ``unknown metabolites'' is still a demanding and intricate task, limiting their usability as functional markers of metabolic processes. As a consequence, previous GWAS largely ignored unknown metabolites as metabolic traits for the analysis. Here we present a systems-level approach that combines genome-wide association analysis and Gaussian graphical modeling with metabolomics to predict the identity of the unknown metabolites. We apply our method to original data of 517 metabolic traits, of which 225 are unknowns, and genotyping information on 655,658 genetic variants, measured in 1,768 human blood samples. We report previously undescribed genotype\textendash{}metabotype associations for six distinct gene loci (SLC22A2, COMT, CYP3A5, CYP2C18, GBA3, UGT3A1) and one locus not related to any known gene (rs12413935). Overlaying the inferred genetic associations, metabolic networks, and knowledge-based pathway information, we derive testable hypotheses on the biochemical identities of 106 unknown metabolites. As a proof of principle, we experimentally confirm nine concrete predictions. We demonstrate the benefit of our method for the functional interpretation of previous metabolomics biomarker studies on liver detoxification, hypertension, and insulin resistance. Our approach is generic in nature and can be directly transferred to metabolomics data from different experimental platforms., Genome-wide association studies on metabolomics data have demonstrated that genetic variation in metabolic enzymes and transporters leads to concentration changes in the respective metabolite levels. The conventional goal of these studies is the detection of novel interactions between the genome and the metabolic system, providing valuable insights for both basic research as well as clinical applications. In this study, we borrow the metabolomics GWAS concept for a novel, entirely different purpose. Metabolite measurements frequently produce signals where a certain substance can be reliably detected in the sample, but it has not yet been elucidated which specific metabolite this signal actually represents. The concept is comparable to a fingerprint: each one is uniquely identifiable, but as long as it is not registered in a database one cannot tell to whom this fingerprint belongs. Obviously, this issue tremendously reduces the usability of a metabolomics analyses. The genetic associations of such an ``unknown,'' however, give us concrete evidence of the metabolic pathway this substance is most probably involved in. Moreover, we complement the approach with a specific measure of correlation between metabolites, providing further evidence of the metabolic processes of the unknown. For a number of cases, this even allows for a concrete identity prediction, which we then experimentally validate in the lab.},

The practice of estimating the precision matrix directly without involving any matrix inversion has obtained significant attention in the literature. We review the methods that have been implemented in R and their R packages, particularly when there are more variables than data samples and discuss ideas behind them. We describe how sparse precision matrix estimation methods can be used to infer network structure. Finally, we discuss methods that are suitable for gene coexpression network construction.

  abstract = {Due to the strong overreliance on p-values in the scientific literature some researchers have argued that p-values should be abandoned or banned, and that we need to move beyond p-values and embrace practical alternatives. When proposing alternatives to p-values statisticians often commit the `Statistician's Fallacy', where they declare which statistic researchers really `want to know'. Instead of telling researchers what they want to know, statisticians should teach researchers which questions they can ask. In some situations, the answer to the question they are most interested in will be the p-value. There is clear room for improvement in how we teach p-values. If anyone really believes p-values are an important cause of problems in science, preventing the misinterpretation of p-values by developing better evidence-based education and user-centered statistical software should be a top priority. At least for some research questions we might not need alternatives to p-values, but can improve our inferences more by using alternatives to null-hypothesis tests. As long as null-hypothesis tests have been criticized, researchers have suggested to include minimal-effects tests and equivalence tests in our statistical toolbox, and these tests have the potential to greatly improve the questions researchers ask.},

The use of graphical models in statistics has increased considerably over recent years and the theory has been greatly developed and extended. This book provides the first comprehensive and authoritative account of the theory of graphical models and is written by a leading expert in the field. It contains the fundamental graph theory required and a thorough study of Markov properties associated with various type of graphs. The statistical theory of log-linear and graphical models for contingency tables, covariance selection models, and graphical models with mixed discrete-continous variables in developed detail. Special topics, such as the application of graphical models to probabilistic expert systems, are described briefly, and appendices give details of the multivarate normal distribution and of the theory of regular exponential families.

An example is the valproic acid (VPA) model of autism, where VPA is administered to pregnant females thereby inducing the disease phenotype in the offspring. With this type of experiment the sample size is the number of litters and not the total number of offspring. If such experiments are not appropriately designed and analysed, the results can be severely biased as well as extremely underpowered.},

For largedimensional covariance matrices, the usual estimator\textemdash{}the sample covariance matrix\textemdash{}is typically not well-conditioned and may not even be invertible. This paper introduces an estimator that is both well-conditioned and more accurate than the sample covariance matrix asymptotically. This estimator is distribution-free and has a simple explicit formula that is easy to compute and interpret. It is the asymptotically optimal convex linear combination of the sample covariance matrix with the identity matrix. Optimality is meant with respect to a quadratic loss function, asymptotically as the number of observations and the number of variables go to infinity together. Extensive Monte Carlo confirm that the asymptotic results tend to hold well in finite sample.},

Here, we investigated whether the link between disgust sensitivity and obesity stigma is specific to pathogen disgust, or whether sexual disgust and moral disgust\textemdash{}two separate functional domains\textemdash{}also relate to negative attitudes toward obese individuals. Additionally, we investigated whether sex differences exist in the manner disgust sensitivity predicts obesity stigma, whether the sexes differ across the subtypes of obesity bias independent of disgust sensitivity, and last, the association between participants' BMI and different subtypes of obesity stigma. In study 1 (N = 92), we established that obesity elicits pathogen, sexual, and moral disgust. In study 2, we investigated the relationship between these types of disgust sensitivity and obesity stigma. Participants (N = 387) reported their level of disgust toward various pathogen, sexual, and moral acts and their attitudes toward obese individuals. For women, but not men, increased pathogen disgust sensitivity predicted more negative attitudes toward obese individuals. Men reported more negative general attitudes toward obese individuals whereas women reported greater fear of becoming obese. The sexes also differed in how their own BMI related to the subtypes of obesity stigma. These findings indicate that pathogen disgust sensitivity plays a role in obesity stigma, specifically for women. Defining the scope of disgust's activation in response to obesity and its relationship with other variables can help identify possible mechanisms for understanding and ultimately alleviating prejudice and discrimination.},

  abstract = {Collectively, machine learning (ML) researchers are engaged in the creation and dissemination of knowledge about data-driven algorithms. In a given paper, researchers might aspire to any subset of the following goals, among others: to theoretically characterize what is learnable, to obtain understanding through empirically rigorous experiments, or to build a working system that has high predictive accuracy. While determining which knowledge warrants inquiry may be subjective, once the topic is fixed, papers are most valuable to the community when they act in service of the reader, creating foundational knowledge and communicating as clearly as possible. Recent progress in machine learning comes despite frequent departures from these ideals. In this paper, we focus on the following four patterns that appear to us to be trending in ML scholarship: (i) failure to distinguish between explanation and speculation; (ii) failure to identify the sources of empirical gains, e.g., emphasizing unnecessary modifications to neural architectures when gains actually stem from hyper-parameter tuning; (iii) mathiness: the use of mathematics that obfuscates or impresses rather than clarifies, e.g., by confusing technical and non-technical concepts; and (iv) misuse of language, e.g., by choosing terms of art with colloquial connotations or by overloading established technical terms. While the causes behind these patterns are uncertain, possibilities include the rapid expansion of the community, the consequent thinness of the reviewer pool, and the often-misaligned incentives between scholarship and short-term measures of success (e.g., bibliometrics, attention, and entrepreneurial opportunity). While each pattern offers a corresponding remedy (don't do it), we also discuss some speculative suggestions for how the community might combat these trends.},

One useful criterion for model selection is generalizability; that is, the chosen model should yield the best predictions for future data. Some researchers in psychology have proposed that the Bayes factor can be used for assessing model generalizability. An alternative method, known as the generalization criterion, has also been proposed for the same purpose. We argue that these two methods address different levels of model generalizability (local and global), and will often produce divergent conclusions. We illustrate this divergence by applying the Bayes factor and the generalization criterion to a comparison of retention functions. The application of alternative model selection criteria will also be demonstrated within the framework of model generalizability.},

Although the growth curve approach is often a good choice, other modeling strategies may more directly answer questions of interest. It is common to see researchers fit growth curve models without considering alterative modeling strategies. In this article we compare 3 approaches for analyzing longitudinal data: repeated measures analysis of variance, covariance pattern models, and growth curve models. As all are members of the general linear mixed model family, they represent somewhat different assumptions about the way individuals change. These assumptions result in different patterns of covariation among the residuals around the fixed effects. In this article, we first indicate the kinds of data that are appropriately modeled by each and use real data examples to demonstrate possible problems associated with the blanket selection of the growth curve model. We then present a simulation that indicates the utility of Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion in the selection of a proper residual covariance structure. The results cast doubt on the popular practice of automatically using growth curve modeling for longitudinal data without comparing the fit of different models. Finally, we provide some practical advice for assessing mean changes in the presence of correlated data.},

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

I set out a criterion of severity akin to the notion of a test's power in Neyman-Pearson statistics.

  abstract = {Background. Obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder (OCD) is often co-morbid with depression. Using the methods of network analysis, we computed two networks that disclose the potentially causal relationships among symptoms of these two disorders in 408 adult patients with primary OCD and co-morbid depression symptoms.
Method. We examined the relationship between the symptoms constituting these syndromes by computing a (regularized) partial correlation network via the graphical LASSO procedure, and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) via a Bayesian hill-climbing algorithm.
Results. The results suggest that the degree of interference and distress associated with obsessions, and the degree of interference associated with compulsions, are the chief drivers of co-morbidity. Moreover, activation of the depression cluster appears to occur solely through distress associated with obsessions activating sadness \textendash{} a key symptom that `bridges' the two syndromic clusters in the DAG.
Conclusions. Bayesian analysis can expand the repertoire of network analytic approaches to psychopathology. We discuss clinical implications and limitations of our findings.},

Most clinicians seem to favor the first view, differing only in whether they conceptualize PTSD as a discrete category or the upper end of a dimension of stress responsiveness. Yet both categorical and dimensional construals presuppose that PTSD symptoms are fallible indicators reflective of an underlying, latent variable. This presupposition has governed psychopathology research for decades, but it rests on problematic psychometric premises. In this article, we review an alternative, network perspective for conceptualizing mental disorders as causal systems of interacting symptoms, and we illustrate this perspective via analyses of PTSD symptoms reported by survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake in China. Finally, we foreshadow emerging computational methods that may disclose the causal structure of mental disorders.},

In many circumstances, violating these assumptions yields estimates of reliability that are too small, making measures look less reliable than they actually are. Although methodological critiques of Cronbach's alpha are being cited with increasing frequency in empirical studies, in this tutorial we discuss how the trend is not necessarily improving methodology used in the literature. That is, many studies continue to use Cronbach's alpha without regard for its assumptions or merely cite methodological articles advising against its use to rationalize unfavorable Cronbach's alpha estimates. This tutorial first provides evidence that recommendations against Cronbach's alpha have not appreciably changed how empirical studies report reliability. Then, we summarize the drawbacks of Cronbach's alpha conceptually without relying on mathematical or simulation-based arguments so that these arguments are accessible to a broad audience. We continue by discussing several alternative measures that make less rigid assumptions which provide justifiably higher estimates of reliability compared to Cronbach's alpha. We conclude with empirical examples to illustrate advantages of alternative measures of reliability including omega total, Revelle's omega total, the greatest lower bound, and Coefficient H. A detailed software appendix is also provided to help researchers implement alternative methods.},

Covariance selection aims at estimating those structural zeros from data. We show that neighborhood selection with the Lasso is a computationally attractive alternative to standard covariance selection for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Neighborhood selection estimates the conditional independence restrictions separately for each node in the graph and is hence equivalent to variable selection for Gaussian linear models. We show that the proposed neighborhood selection scheme is consistent for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Consistency hinges on the choice of the penalty parameter. The oracle value for optimal prediction does not lead to a consistent neighborhood estimate. Controlling instead the probability of falsely joining some distinct connectivity components of the graph, consistent estimation for sparse graphs is achieved (with exponential rates), even when the number of variables grows as the number of observations raised to an arbitrary power.},

We present a Bayesian variable-selection method to identify the active regions in the brain as a response to a certain stimulus. We build binary classification models of subject level responses by using binary regression with Gaussian models on the latent variables. We also study the scaled normal priors on the latent variables, as they cover a large family of distributions. We use continuous spike-and-slab priors to incorporate variable selection within the modelling. Because of the computational complexity, we build many local (at different time points) models and make predictions by utilizing the temporal structure between the local models. We perform two-stage variable selection for each of these local models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such modelling through the results of a simulation study. We then present the performance of these models on multisubject neuroimaging (electroencephalography) data to study the effects on the functional states of the frontal cortex and parietal lobe for chronic exposure of alcohol.},

Amer. Statist. Assoc. 104 (2009) 1261\textendash{}1271]. However, in models where the number of parameters increases as the sample size increases, properties of the Bayes factor are not totally understood. Here we study consistency of the Bayes factors for nested normal linear models when the number of regressors increases with the sample size. We pay attention to two successful tools for model selection [Schwarz Ann. Statist. 6 (1978) 461\textendash{}464] approximation to the Bayes factor, and the Bayes factor for intrinsic priors [Berger and Pericchi J. Amer. Statist.

We find that the the Schwarz approximation and the Bayes factor for intrinsic priors are consistent when the rate of growth of the dimension of the bigger model is O(nb) for b\,{$<$}\,1. When b\,=\,1 the Schwarz approximation is always inconsistent under the alternative while the Bayes factor for intrinsic priors is consistent except for a small set of alternative models which is characterized.},

  abstract = {Several issues are discussed when testing inequality constrained hypotheses using a Bayesian approach. First, the complexity (or size) of the inequality constrained parameter spaces can be ignored. This is the case when using the posterior probability that the inequality constraints of a hypothesis hold, Bayes factors based on non-informative improper priors, and partial Bayes factors based on posterior priors. Second, the Bayes factor may not be invariant for linear one-to-one transformations of the data. This can be observed when using balanced priors which are centred on the boundary of the constrained parameter space with a diagonal covariance structure. Third, the information paradox can be observed. When testing inequality constrained hypotheses, the information paradox occurs when the Bayes factor of an inequality constrained hypothesis against its complement converges to a constant as the evidence for the first hypothesis accumulates while keeping the sample size fixed. This paradox occurs when using Zellner's g prior as a result of too much prior shrinkage. Therefore, two new methods are proposed that avoid these issues. First, partial Bayes factors are proposed based on transformed minimal training samples. These training samples result in posterior priors that are centred on the boundary of the constrained parameter space with the same covariance structure as in the sample. Second, a g prior approach is proposed by letting g go to infinity. This is possible because the Jeffreys\textendash{}Lindley paradox is not an issue when testing inequality constrained hypotheses. A simulation study indicated that the Bayes factor based on this g prior approach converges fastest to the true inequality constrained hypothesis.},

A diffuse prior on the correlation matrix is used that minimizes prior shrinkage and results in most evidence for an order-constrained hypothesis that is supported by the data. An efficient method is proposed for the computation of the Bayes factor. A key aspect in the computation is a Fisher Z transformation on the posterior distribution of the correlations such that an approximately normal distribution is obtained. The methodology is implemented in a freely downloadable software program called ``BOCOR''. The methods are applied to a multitrait\textendash{}multimethod analysis, a repeated measures study, and a study on directed moderator effects.},

In many applications researchers can translate scientific expectations to hypotheses with equality and/or order constraints on these measures of association. In this paper a Bayes factor test is proposed for testing multiple hypotheses with constraints on the measures of association between ordinal and/or continuous variables, possibly after correcting for certain covariates. This test can be used to obtain a direct answer to the research question how much evidence there is in the data for a social science theory relative to competing theories. The accompanying software package `BCT' allows users to apply the methodology in an easy manner. An empirical application from leisure studies about the associations between life, leisure and relationship satisfaction and an application about the differences about egalitarian justice beliefs across countries are used to illustrate the methodology.},

The result is a set of informative hypotheses. In this paper, the Bayes factor is used to determine which hypothesis receives most support from the data. A pivotal element in the Bayesian framework is the specification of the prior. To avoid subjective prior specification, training data in combination with restrictions on the measurement means are used to obtain so-called constrained posterior priors.

  abstract = {Complex dependency structures are often conditionally modeled, where random effects parameters are used to specify the natural heterogeneity in the population. When interest is focused on the dependency structure, inferences can be made from a complex covariance matrix using a marginal modeling approach. In this marginal modeling framework, testing covariance parameters is not a boundary problem. Bayesian tests on covariance parameter(s) of the compound symmetry structure are proposed assuming multivariate normally distributed observations. Innovative proper prior distributions are introduced for the covariance components such that the positive definiteness of the (compound symmetry) covariance matrix is ensured. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed priors on the covariance parameters lead to a balanced Bayes factor, in case of testing an inequality constrained hypothesis. As an illustration, the proposed Bayes factor is used for testing (non-)invariant intra-class correlations across different group types (public and Catholic schools), using the 1982 High School and Beyond survey data.},

  abstract = {The Schwarz or Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is one of the most widely used tools for model comparison in social science research. The BIC, however, is not suitable for evaluating models with order constraints on the parameters of interest. This article explores two extensions of the BIC for evaluating order-constrained models, one where a truncated unit information prior is used under the order-constrained model and the other where a truncated local unit information prior is used. The first prior is centered on the maximum likelihood estimate, and the latter prior is centered on a null value. Several analyses show that the order-constrained BIC based on the local unit information prior works better as an Occam's razor for evaluating order-constrained models and results in lower error probabilities. The methodology based on the local unit information prior is implemented in the R package ``BICpack'' which allows researchers to easily apply the method for order-constrained model selection. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated using data from the European Values Study.},

  abstract = {Circular data are encountered throughout a variety of scientific disciplines, such as in eye movement research as the direction of saccades. Motivated by such applications, mixtures of peaked circular distributions are developed. The peaked distributions are a novel family of Batschelet-type distributions, where the shape of the distribution is warped by means of a transformation function. Because the Inverse Batschelet distribution features an implicit inverse that is not computationally feasible for large or complex data, an alternative called the Power Batschelet distribution is introduced. This distribution is easy to compute and mimics the behavior of the Inverse Batschelet distribution. Inference is performed in both the frequentist framework, through Expectation\textendash{}Maximization (EM) and the bootstrap, and the Bayesian framework, through MCMC. All parameters can be fixed, which may be done by assumption to reduce the number of parameters. Model comparison can be performed through information criteria or through bridge sampling in the Bayesian framework, which allows performing a wealth of hypothesis tests through the Bayes factor. An R package, flexcircmix, is available to perform these analyses.},

For example, it may be expected that the effect of the first predictor is larger than the effect of the second predictor, and the second predictor is expected to be larger than the third predictor. The goal is then to test such expectations against competing scientific expectations or theories. In this paper, a simple default Bayes factor test is proposed for testing multiple hypotheses with equality and order constraints on the effects of interest. The proposed testing criterion can be computed without requiring external prior information about the expected effects before observing the data. The method is implemented in R-package called `lmhyp' which is freely downloadable and ready to use. The usability of the method and software is illustrated using empirical applications from the social and behavioral sciences.},

Consideration of between- and within-cluster effects also helps to explain observed and theoretical differences between mixture model analyses and those based on conditional likelihood methods. In particular, we show that conditional likelihood methods estimate purely within-cluster covariate effects, whereas mixture model approaches estimate a weighted average of between- and within-cluster covariate effects.},

However, there are difficulties with this approach when prior information about the parameters of the various models is weak. Partial Bayes factors offer a resolution of the problem by setting aside part of the data as a training sample. The training sample is used to obtain an initial informative posterior distribution of the parameters in each model. Model comparison is then based on a Bayes factor calculated from the remaining data. Properties of partial Bayes factors are discussed, particularly in the context of weak prior information, and they are found to have advantages over other proposed methods of model comparison. A new variant of the partial Bayes factor, the fractional Bayes factor, is advocated on grounds of consistency, simplicity, robustness and coherence.},

With the selective shrinkage, this setup incorporates the zero coefficient contingency directly into the modeling process to produce pos-terior probabilities for hypothesized outcomes. We extend the model to qualitative responses by designing a hierarchy of forms over both the parameter and model spaces to achieve variable selection, model averaging, and individual coefficient hypothesis testing. To overcome the technical challenges in estimating the marginal posterior distributions possibly with a dramatic ratio of density heights of the spike to the slab, we develop a hybrid Gibbs sampling algorithm using an adaptive rejection ap-proach for various discrete outcome models, including dichotomous, polychotomous, and count responses. The performance of the models and methods are assessed with both Monte Carlo experiments and empirical applications in political science.},

  abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

The MELSM includes person and time-varying variables to predict the location, or individual means, and the scale, or within-person variances. It also incorporates a submodel to account for between-person variances. The dyadic specification can accommodate individual and partner effects in both the location and the scale components, and allows random effects for all location and scale parameters. All covariances among the random effects, within and across the location and the scale are also estimated. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay of individual mean structures, intra-individual variability, and the influence of partner effects on such factors. To illustrate the model, we use data from 274 couples who provided daily ratings on their positive and negative emotions toward their relationship \textendash{} up to 90 consecutive days. The model is fit using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods, and includes subsets of predictors in order to demonstrate the flexibility of this approach. We conclude with a discussion on the usefulness and the limitations of the MELSM for dyadic research.},

  abstract = {The network approach to psychopathology conceptualizes mental disorders as networks of mutually reinforcing nodes (i.e., symptoms). Researchers adopting this approach have suggested that network topology can be used to identify influential nodes, with nodes central to the network having the greatest influence on the development and maintenance of the disorder. However, because commonly used centrality indices do not distinguish between positive and negative edges, they may not adequately assess the nature and strength of a node's influence within the network. To address this limitation, we developed two indices of a node's expected influence (EI) that account for the presence of negative edges. To evaluate centrality and EI indices, we simulated single-node interventions on randomly generated networks. In networks with exclusively positive edges, centrality and EI were both strongly associated with observed node influence. In networks with negative edges, EI was more strongly associated with observed influence than was centrality. We then used data from a longitudinal study of bereavement to examine the association between (a) a node's centrality and EI in the complicated grief (CG) network and (b) the strength of association between change in that node and change in the remainder of the CG network from 6 to 18-months post-loss. Centrality and EI were both correlated with the strength of the association between node change and network change. These findings suggest high-EI nodes, such as emotional pain and feeling of emptiness, may be especially important to the etiology and treatment of CG., Complicated grief can be conceptualized as a network of mutually reinforcing symptoms. Centrality and expected influence indices aim to use the structure of the complicated grief network to identify symptoms that should be especially important to its development and persistence. We found that change in symptoms with high expected influence was more strongly tied to change in the severity of complicated grief than was change in symptoms with low expected influence, suggesting that this index is able to identify symptoms that may play an important role in the etiology and treatment of complicated grief.},

            The network approach to psychopathology posits that mental disorders can be conceptualized and studied as causal systems of mutually reinforcing symptoms. This approach, first posited in 2008, has grown substantially over the past decade and is now a full-fledged area of psychiatric research. In this article, we provide an overview and critical analysis of 363 articles produced in the first decade of this research program, with a focus on key theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions. In addition, we turn our attention to the next decade of the network approach and propose critical avenues for future research in each of these domains. We argue that this program of research will be best served by working toward two overarching aims: (a) the identification of robust empirical phenomena and (b) the development of formal theories that can explain those phenomena. We recommend specific steps forward within this broad framework and argue that these steps are necessary if the network approach is to develop into a progressive program of research capable of producing a cumulative body of knowledge about how specific mental disorders operate as causal systems.},

Virtually every introductory statistics class treats the topic, though textbooks and the statistical literature show mostly superficial treatment, weak pedagogy, and substantial confusion. Fisher first defined degrees of freedom in 1915, and Walker provided technical treatment of the concept in 1940. In this article, the history of degrees of freedom is reviewed, and the pedagogical challenges are discussed. The core of the article is a simple reconceptualization of the degrees-of-freedom concept that is easier to teach and to learn than the traditional treatment. This reconceptualization defines a statistical bank, into which are deposited data points. These data points are used to estimate statistical models; some data are used up in estimating a model, and some data remain in the bank. The several types of degrees of freedom define an accounting process that simply counts the flow of data from the statistical bank into the model. The overall reconceptualization is based on basic economic principles, including treating data as statistical capital and data exchangeability (fungibility). The goal is to stimulate discussion of degrees of freedom that will improve its use and understanding in pedagogical and applied settings.},

We provide an overview of each method and show that a salient difference is the choice of models. The two approaches as commonly practiced can be unified with a certain model specification, now popular in the statistics literature, called spike-and-slab priors. A spike-and-slab prior is a mixture of a null model, the spike, with an effect model, the slab. The estimate of the effect size here is a function of the Bayes factor, showing that estimation and model comparison can be unified. The salient difference is that common Bayes factor approaches provide for privileged consideration of theoretically useful parameter values, such as the value corresponding to the null hypothesis, while estimation approaches do not. Both approaches, either privileging the null or not, are useful depending on the goals of the analyst.},

We present an alternative goal for meta-analysis. The analyst may ask about relations that are stable across all the studies. In a typical meta-analysis, there is a hypothesized direction (e.g., that violent video games increase, rather than decrease, aggressive behavior). We ask whether all studies in a meta-analysis have true effects in the hypothesized direction. If so, this is an example of a stable relation across all the studies. We propose four models: (i) all studies are truly null; (ii) all studies share a single true nonzero effect; (iii) studies differ, but all true effects are in the same direction; and (iv) some study effects are truly positive while others are truly negative. We develop Bayes factor model comparison for these models and apply them to four extant meta-analyses to show their usefulness.},

We present the argument that there is no free lunch; that is, valid testing requires that researchers test the null against a well-specified alternative. We show how this requirement follows from the basic tenets of conventional and Bayesian probability. Moreover, we show in both the conventional and Bayesian framework that not specifying the alternative may lead to rejections of the null hypothesis with scant evidence. We review both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to specifying alternatives, and we show how such specifications improve inference. The field of cognitive science will benefit because consideration of reasonable alternatives will undoubtedly sharpen the intellectual underpinnings of research.},

In this paper, we critically evaluate the use of PMRF-based methods to generate causal hypotheses about an underlying directed causal structure. We argue that hypothesis generation is critically dependent on the specification of a target causal structure: This is generally absent from applications of PMRFs, researchers instead taking a causally-agnostic approach. We show that the agnostic approach is fundamentally problematic, since the heuristics typically used for hypothesis generation do not hold for all types of causal structure. The specification of a target structure, however, allows a principled approach to hypothesis generation and yields novel insights.},

  abstract = {Experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas of cognitive science are increasingly being analyzed using Bayesian methods. This has been facilitated by the development of probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, and easily accessible front-end packages such as brms. However, the utility of Bayesian methods ultimately depends on the relevance of the Bayesian model, in particular whether or not it accurately captures the structure of the data and the data analyst's domain expertise. Even with powerful software, the analyst is responsible for verifying the utility of their model. To accomplish this, we introduce a principled Bayesian workflow (Betancourt, 2018) to cognitive science. Using a concrete working example, we describe basic questions one should ask about the model: prior predictive checks, computational faithfulness, model sensitivity, and posterior predictive checks. The running example for demonstrating the workflow is data on reading times with a linguistic manipulation of object versus subject relative sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow also demonstrates how to use domain knowledge to inform prior distributions. It provides guidelines and checks for valid data analysis, avoiding overfitting complex models to noise, and capturing relevant data structure in a probabilistic model. Given the increasing use of Bayesian methods, we aim to discuss how these methods can be properly employed to obtain robust answers to scientific questions.

  abstract = {For several years, the public debate in psychological science has been dominated by what is referred to as the reproducibility crisis. This crisis has, inter alia, drawn attention to the need for proper control of statistical decision errors in testing psychological hypotheses. However, conventional methods of error probability control often require fairly large samples. Sequential statistical tests provide an attractive alternative: They can be applied repeatedly during the sampling process and terminate whenever there is sufficient evidence in the data for one of the hypotheses of interest. Thus, sequential tests may substantially reduce the required sample size without compromising predefined error probabilities. Herein, we discuss the most efficient sequential design, the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), and show how it is easily implemented for a 2-sample t test using standard statistical software. We demonstrate, by means of simulations, that the SPRT not only reliably controls error probabilities but also typically requires substantially smaller samples than standard t tests and other common sequential designs. Moreover, we investigate the robustness of the SPRT against violations of its assumptions. Finally, we illustrate the sequential t test by applying it to an empirical example and provide recommendations on how psychologists can employ it in their own research to benefit from its desirable properties.},

We argue that more can be learned from data by evaluating informative hypotheses, than by testing the traditional null hypothesis. All criticisms of classical null hypothesis testing aside, the best argument for evaluating informative hypotheses is that many researchers want to evaluate their expectations directly, but have been unable to do so because the statistical tools were not yet available. It will be shown that a Bayesian model selection procedure can be used to evaluate informative hypotheses in structural equation models using the software Mplus. In the current paper we introduce the methodology using a real-life example taken from the field of developmental psychology about depressive symptoms in adolescence and provide a step-by-step description so that the procedure becomes more comprehensible for applied researchers. As this paper illustrates, this methodology is ready to be used by any researcher within the social sciences.},

Yet despite these expectations, most investigators still use null hypothesis testing to evaluate their data, that is, when analysing their data they ignore the expectations they have. In the present article, Bayesian model selection is presented as a means to evaluate the expectations researchers have, that is, to evaluate so called informative hypotheses. Although the methodology to do this has been described in previous articles, these are rather technical and havemainly been published in statistical journals. The main objective of thepresent article is to provide a basic introduction to the evaluation of informative hypotheses using Bayesian model selection. Moreover, what is new in comparison to previous publications on this topic is that we provide guidelines on how to interpret the results. Bayesian evaluation of informative hypotheses is illustrated using an example concerning psychosocial functioning and the interplay between personality and support from family.},

In this book Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines address these questions using the formalism of Bayes networks, with results that have been applied in diverse areas of research in the social, behavioral, and physical sciences. The authors show that although experimental and observational study designs may not always permit the same inferences, they are subject to uniform principles. They axiomatize the connection between causal structure and probabilistic independence, explore several varieties of causal indistinguishability, formulate a theory of manipulation, and develop asymptotically reliable procedures for searching over equivalence classes of causal models, including models of categorical data and structural equation models with and without latent variables. The authors show that the relationship between causality and probability can also help to clarify such diverse topics in statistics as the comparative power of experimentation versus observation, Simpson's paradox, errors in regression models, retrospective versus prospective sampling, and variable selection. The second edition contains a new introduction and an extensive survey of advances and applications that have appeared since the first edition was published in 1993.},

  abstract = {Background Cognitive abilities, such as working memory, differ among people; however, individuals also vary in their own day-to-day cognitive performance. One potential source of cognitive variability may be fluctuations in the functional organization of neural systems. The degree to which the organization of these functional networks is optimized may relate to the effective cognitive functioning of the individual. Here we specifically examine how changes in the organization of large-scale networks measured via resting state functional connectivity MRI and graph theory track changes in working memory capacity. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-two participants performed a test of working memory capacity and then underwent resting-state fMRI. Seventeen subjects repeated the protocol three weeks later. We applied graph theoretic techniques to measure network organization on 34 brain regions of interest (ROI). Network modularity, which measures the level of integration and segregation across sub-networks, and small-worldness, which measures global network connection efficiency, both predicted individual differences in memory capacity; however, only modularity predicted intra-individual variation across the two sessions. Partial correlations controlling for the component of working memory that was stable across sessions revealed that modularity was almost entirely associated with the variability of working memory at each session. Analyses of specific sub-networks and individual circuits were unable to consistently account for working memory capacity variability. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that the intrinsic functional organization of an a priori defined cognitive control network measured at rest provides substantial information about actual cognitive performance. The association of network modularity to the variability in an individual's working memory capacity suggests that the organization of this network into high connectivity within modules and sparse connections between modules may reflect effective signaling across brain regions, perhaps through the modulation of signal or the suppression of the propagation of noise.},

  abstract = {Introduction: In clinical settings, neuropsychological test performance is traditionally evaluated with total summary scores (TSS). However, recent studies demonstrated that indices of intraindividual variability (IIV) yielded unique information complementing TSS. This 18-month longitudinal study sought to determine whether IIV indices derived from a multitrial list-learning test (the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) provided incremental utility in predicting cognitive decline in older adults compared to TSS. Method: Ninety-nine cognitively intact older adults (aged 65 to 89 years) underwent neuropsychological testing (including the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) at baseline and 18-month follow-up. Participants were classified as cognitively stable (n = 65) or declining (n = 34) based on changes in their neuropsychological test performance. Logistic regression modeling tested the ability of baseline TSS indices (sum of Trials 1\textendash{}5, immediate recall, and delayed recall) and IIV indices (lost access and gained access) to discriminate between stable and declining individuals. Results: Higher values of both lost access and gained access at baseline were associated with an increased risk for decline at 18-month follow-up. Further, the IIV indices provided predictive utility above and beyond the TSS indices. Conclusion: These results highlight the value of analyzing IIV in addition to TSS during neuropsychological evaluation in older adults. High levels of IIV may reflect impairment in anterograde memory systems and/or executive dysfunction that may serve as a prognostic indicator of cognitive decline.},

This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

  abstract = {Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) has recently gained popularity because it enables researchers to fit complex models and solve some of the issues often encountered in classical maximum likelihood estimation, such as nonconvergence and inadmissible solutions. An important component of any Bayesian analysis is the prior distribution of the unknown model parameters. Often, researchers rely on default priors, which are constructed in an automatic fashion without requiring substantive prior information. However, the prior can have a serious influence on the estimation of the model parameters, which affects the mean squared error, bias, coverage rates, and quantiles of the estimates. In this article, we investigate the performance of three different default priors: noninformative improper priors, vague proper priors, and empirical Bayes priors\textemdash{}with the latter being novel in the BSEM literature. Based on a simulation study, we find that these three default BSEM methods may perform very differently, especially with small samples. A careful prior sensitivity analysis is therefore needed when performing a default BSEM analysis. For this purpose, we provide a practical step-by-step guide for practitioners to conducting a prior sensitivity analysis in default BSEM. Our recommendations are illustrated using a well-known case study from the structural equation modeling literature, and all code for conducting the prior sensitivity analysis is available in the online supplemental materials.},

  abstract = {One of the most consistent findings in children with ADHD is increased moment-to-moment variability in reaction time (RT). The source of increased RT variability can be examined using ex-Gaussian analyses that divide variability into normal and exponential components and Fast Fourier transform (FFT) that allow for detailed examination of the frequency of responses in the exponential distribution. Prior studies of ADHD using these methods have produced variable results, potentially related to differences in task demand. The present study sought to examine the profile of RT variability in ADHD using two Go/No-go tasks with differing levels of cognitive demand. A total of 140 children (57 with ADHD and 83 typically developing controls), ages 8\textendash{}13 years, completed both a ``simple'' Go/No-go task and a more ``complex'' Go/No-go task with increased working memory load. Repeated measures ANOVA of ex-Gaussian functions revealed for both tasks children with ADHD demonstrated increased variability in both the normal/Gaussian (significantly elevated sigma) and the exponential (significantly elevated tau) components. In contrast, FFT analysis of the exponential component revealed a significant task\texttimes{}diagnosis interaction, such that infrequent slow responses in ADHD differed depending on task demand (i.e., for the simple task, increased power in the 0.027\textendash{}0.074Hz frequency band; for the complex task, decreased power in the 0.074\textendash{}0.202Hz band). The ex-Gaussian findings revealing increased variability in both the normal (sigma) and exponential (tau) components for the ADHD group, suggest that both impaired response preparation and infrequent ``lapses in attention'' contribute to increased variability in ADHD. FFT analyses reveal that the periodicity of intermittent lapses of attention in ADHD varies with task demand. The findings provide further support for intra-individual variability as a candidate intermediate endophenotype of ADHD.},

In observational studies, however, longitudinal changes need to be studied after correction for potential important cross-sectional differences between subjects. It will be shown that, in the context of linear mixed models, the estimation of longitudinal effects may be highly influenced by the assumptions about cross-sectional effects. Furthermore, aspects from conditional and mixture inference will be combined, yielding so-called conditional linear mixed models that allow estimation of longitudinal effects (average trends as well as subject-specific trends), independent of any cross-sectional assumptions. These models will be introduced and justified, and extensively illustrated in the analysis of longitudinal data from 680 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.},

  abstract = {In this paper test criteria are developed for testing hypotheses of "compound symmetry" in a normal multivariate population of t variates (t {$\geq$} 3) on basis of samples. A feature common to the twelve hypotheses considered is that the set of t variates is partitioned into mutually exclusive subsets of variates. In regard to the partitioning, the twelve hypotheses can be divided into two contrasting but very similar types, and the six in one type can be paired off in a natural way with the six in the other type. Three of the hypotheses within a given type are associated with the case of a single sample and moreover are simple modifications of one another; the remaining three are direct extensions of the first three, respectively, to the case of k samples (k {$\geq$} 2). The gist of any of the hypotheses is indicated in the following statement of one, denoted by H1(mvc): within each subset of variates the means are equal, the variances are equal and the covariances are equal and between any two distinct subsets the covariances are equal. The twelve sample criteria for testing the hypotheses are developed by the Neyman-Pearson likelihood-ratio method. The following results are obtained for each criterion (assuming that the respective null hypotheses are true) for any admissible partition of the t variates into subsets and for any sample size, N, for which the criterion's distribution exists: (i) the exact moments; (ii) an identification of the exact distribution as the distribution of a product of independent beta variates; (iii) the approximate distribution for large N. Exact distributions of the single-sample criteria are given explicitly for special values of t and special partitionings. Certain psychometric and medical research problems in which hypotheses of compound symmetry are relevant are discussed in section 1. Sections 2-6 give statements of the hypotheses and an illustration, for H1(mvc), of the technique of obtaining the moments and identifying the distributions. Results for the other criteria are given in sections 7-8. Illustrative examples showing applications of the results are given in section 9.},

The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label ``confirmatory,'' and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled ``exploratory.'' We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception.},

Our results aligned with statistical power theory, in that, greater power was observed for designs with more individuals, more repeated occasions, greater proportions of variance available to be explained, and larger effect sizes. In addition, our results indicated that Type I error rates were acceptable in situations when individual differences in intra-individual variability were not initially detectable as well as when the scale-model individual-level predictor explained all initially detectable individual differences in intra-individual variability.

In this approach, samples are drawn from the prior and posterior distributions of an encompassing model that contains an inequality restricted version as a special case. The Bayes factor in favor of the inequality restriction then simplifies to the ratio of the proportions of posterior and prior samples consistent with the inequality restriction. This formalism has been applied almost exclusively to models with inequality or ``about equality'' constraints. It is shown that the EP approach naturally extends to exact equality constraints by considering the ratio of the heights for the posterior and prior distributions at the point that is subject to test (i.e.,~the Savage\textendash{}Dickey density ratio). The EP approach generalizes the Savage\textendash{}Dickey ratio method, and can accommodate both inequality and exact equality constraints. The general EP approach is found to be a computationally efficient procedure to calculate Bayes factors for nested models. However, the EP approach to exact equality constraints is vulnerable to the Borel\textendash{}Kolmogorov paradox, the consequences of which warrant careful consideration.},

  abstract = {Intensive longitudinal studies and experience sampling methods are becoming more common in psychology. While they provide a unique opportunity to ask novel questions about withinperson processes relating to personality, there is a lack of methods specifically built to characterize the interplay between traits and states. We thus introduce a Bayesian multivariate mixed-effects location scale model (M-MELSM). The formulation can simultaneously model both personality traits (the location) and states (the scale) for multivariate data common to personality research. Variables can be included to predict either (or both) the traits and states, in addition to estimating random effects therein. This provides correlations between location and scale random effects, both across and within each outcome, which allows for characterizing relations between any number personality traits and the corresponding states. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only to make estimation possible, but also because it provides the necessary information for use in psychological applications such as hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model we use data from 194 individuals that provided daily ratings of negative and positive affect, as well as their psychical activity in the form of step counts over 100 consecutive days. We describe the fitted model, where we emphasize, with visualization, the richness of information provided by the M-MELSM. We demonstrate Bayesian hypothesis testing for the correlations between the random effects. We conclude by discussing limitations of the MELSM in general and extensions to the M-MELSM specifically for personality research.},

Here a novel testing strategy is introduced that can provide evidence for a null, negative, or positive effect. We then introduce a  test for hypotheses with order constraints on partial correlations. This allows for testing theoretical and clinical expectations in GGMs. The novel matrix\$-F\$ prior distribution is described that provides increased flexibility in specification compared to the Wishart prior. The methods are applied to PTSD symptoms. In several applications, we demonstrate how the exploratory and confirmatory approaches can work in tandem: hypotheses are formulated from an initial analysis and then tested in an independent dataset.

The NL-MELSM allows for fitting nonlinear functions to the location, or individual means, and the scale, or within-person variance. Specifically, in the context of learning, this model allows the within-person variance to follow a nonlinear trajectory, where it can be determined whether variability reduces during learning. It incorporates a sub-model that can predict nonlinear parameters for both the location and scale. This specification estimates random effects for all nonlinear location and scale parameters that are drawn from a common multivariate distribution. This allows estimation of covariances among the random effects, within and across the location and the scale. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay between individual mean structures and intraindividual variability in nonlinear parameters. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only for ease of estimation but also for inference because it provides the necessary and consistent information for use in psychological applications, such as model selection and hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model, we use data from 333 individuals, consisting of three age groups, who participated in five learning trials that assessed verbal memory. In an exploratory context, we demonstrate that fitting a nonlinear function to the within-person variance, and allowing for individual variation therein, improves predictive accuracy compared to customary modeling techniques (e.g., assuming constant variance). We conclude by discussing the usefulness, limitations, and future directions of the NL-MELSM.},

The first is based on the posterior predictive distribution, with a symmetric version of Kullback-Leibler divergence as the discrepancy measure, that tests differences between two (or more) multivariate normal distributions. The second approach makes use of Bayesian model comparison, with the Bayes factor, and allows for gaining evidence for invariant network structures. This overcomes limitations of current approaches in the literature that use classical hypothesis testing, where it is only possible to determine whether groups are significantly different from each other. With simulation we show the posterior predictive method is approximately calibrated under the null hypothesis ({$\alpha$} = .05) and has more power to detect differences than alternative approaches. We then examine the necessary sample sizes for detecting invariant network structures with Bayesian hypothesis testing, in addition to how this is influenced by the choice of prior distribution. The methods are applied to posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms that were measured in 4 groups. We end by summarizing our major contribution, that is proposing 2 novel methods for comparing Gaussian graphical models (GGMs), which extends beyond the social-behavioral sciences. The methods have been implemented in the R package BGGM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {The topic of replicability has recently captivated the emerging field of network psychometrics. Although methodological practice (e.g., p-hacking) has been identified as a root cause of unreliable research findings in psychological science, the statistical model itself has come under attack in the partial correlation network literature. In a motivating example, I first describe how sampling variability inherent to partial correlations can merely give the appearance of unreliability. For example, when going from zero-order to partial correlations there is necessarily more sampling variability that translates into reduced statistical power. I then introduce novel methodology for deriving expected network replicability. This analytic solution can be used with Pearson, Spearman, and polychoric partial correlations. I employ the method to highlight an additional source of sampling variability, that is, when going from continuous to ordinal data with few categories: in networks with 20 variables (N = 500) replicability can exceed 50\% for continuous data but this decreases to less than 25\% for ordinal data! Additionally, I propose using the smallest edge size of interest to achieve a desired level of replicability in network models. I end with recommendations that include the importance of the network literature repositioning itself with gold-standard approaches for assessing replication (e.g., by using methods with defined error rates). I have implemented the method for computing expected network replicability in the R package GGMnonreg.},

  abstract = {An important goal for psychological science is developing methods to characterize relationships between variables. Customary approaches use structural equation models to connect latent factors to a number of observed measurements, or test causal hypotheses between observed variables. More recently, regularized partial correlation networks have been proposed as an alternative approach for characterizing relationships among variables through off-diagonal elements in the precision matrix. While the graphical Lasso (glasso) has emerged as the default network estimation method, it was optimized in fields outside of psychology with very different needs, such as high dimensional data where the number of variables (p) exceeds the number of observations (n). In this article, we describe the glasso method in the context of the fields where it was developed, and then we demonstrate that the advantages of regularization diminish in settings where psychological networks are often fitted (p{$\ll$}n). We first show that improved properties of the precision matrix, such as eigenvalue estimation, and predictive accuracy with cross-validation are not always appreciable. We then introduce nonregularized methods based on multiple regression and a nonparametric bootstrap strategy, after which we characterize performance with extensive simulations. Our results demonstrate that the nonregularized methods can be used to reduce the false-positive rate, compared to glasso, and they appear to provide consistent performance across sparsity levels, sample composition (p/n), and partial correlation size. We end by reviewing recent findings in the statistics literature that suggest alternative methods often have superior performance than glasso, as well as suggesting areas for future research in psychology. The nonregularized methods have been implemented in the R package GGMnonreg.},

  abstract = {Measurement reliability is a fundamental concept in psychology. It is traditionally considered a stable property of a questionnaire, measurement device, or experimental task. Although intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) are often used to assess reliability in repeated measure designs, their descriptive nature depends upon the assumption of a commonwithin-person variance.This work focuses on the presumption that each individual is adequately described by the average within-person variance in hierarchical models. And thus whether reliability generalizes to the individual level, which leads directly into the notion of individually varying ICCs. In particular, we introduce a novel approach, using the Bayes factor, wherein a researcher can directly test for homogeneous within-person variance in hierarchical models. Additionally, we introduce a membership model that allows for classifying which (and how many) individuals belong to the common variance model. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated on cognitive inhibition tasks. We find that heterogeneous within-person variance is a defining feature of these tasks, and in one case, the ratio between the largest to smallest within-person variance exceeded 20. This translates into a 10 fold difference in person-specific reliability! We also find that few individuals belong to the common variance model, and thus traditional reliability indices are potentially masking important individual variation. We discuss the implications of our findings and possible future directions. The methods are implemented in the R package vICC.},

  abstract = {Mixed-effects models are becoming common in psychological science. Although they have many desirable features, there is still untapped potential . It is customary to view homogeneous variance as an assumption to satisfy. We argue to move beyond that perspective, and to view modeling within-person variance (``noise'') as an opportunity to gain a richer understanding of psychological processes. The technique to do so is based on the mixed-effects location scale model that can simultaneously estimate mixed-effects sub-models to both the mean (location) and within-person variance (scale). We develop a framework that goes beyond assessing the sub-models in isolation of one another, and provide a novel testing strategy for the correlations between individual difference parameters across the mean and within-person variance sub-models with the Bayes factor. We first present a motivating example, which makes clear our testing strategy for mean\textendash{}variance relations. We then apply the method to reaction times gathered from two cognitive inhibition tasks. We find there are more individual differences in the within-person variance than the mean structure, as well as a complex web of structural mean\textendash{}variance relations in the distribution of random effects. This stands in contrast to the dominant view of within-person variance\textendash{}i.e., measurement ``error'' or ``noise.'' The results also point towards paradoxical within-person, as opposed to between-person, effects: several people had slower and less variable incongruent responses which contradicts the typical pattern, wherein larger means are expected to be more variable. We conclude with future directions that span from methodological to theoretical inquires that can be answered with the presented methodology.},

  abstract = {Network psychometrics is undergoing a time of methodological reflection. In part, this was spurred by the revelation that l1-regularization does not reduce spurious associations in partial correlation networks. In this work, we address another motivation for the widespread use of regularized estimation: the thought that it is needed to mitigate overfitting. We first clarify important aspects of overfitting and the bias-variance tradeoff that are especially relevant for the network literature, where the number of nodes or items in a psychometric scale are not largecompared to the number of observations (i.e., a low p/n ratio). This revealed that bias and especially variance are most problematic in p=n ratios rarely encountered. We then introduce a nonregularized method, based on classical hypothesis testing, that fulfills two desiderata: (1) reducing or controlling the false positives rate and (2) quelling concerns of overfitting by providing accurate predictions. These were the primary motivations for initially adopting the graphical lasso (glasso). In several simulation studies, our nonregularized method provided more than competitive predictive performance, and, in many cases, outperformed glasso. Itappears to be nonregularized, as opposed to regularized estimation, that best satisfies these desiderata. We then provide insights into using our methodology. Here we discuss the multiple comparisons problem in relation to prediction: stringent alpha levels, resulting in a sparse network, can deteriorate predictive accuracy. We end by emphasizing key advantages of our approach that make it ideal for both inference and prediction in network analysis.},

A large literature in psycholinguistics has examined the statistical treatment of random stimulus materials, but the recommendations from this literature have not been applied to the social psychological literature on implicit attitudes. This is partly because of inherent complications in applying crossed random-effect models to some of the most common implicit attitude tasks, and partly because no work to date has demonstrated that random stimulus variation is in fact consequential in implicit attitude measurement. We addressed this problem by laying out statistically appropriate and practically feasible crossed random-effect models for three of the most commonly used implicit attitude measures\textemdash{}the Implicit Association Test, affect misattribution procedure, and evaluative priming task\textemdash{}and then applying these models to large datasets (average N = 3,206) that assess participants' implicit attitudes toward race, politics, and self-esteem. We showed that the test statistics from the traditional analyses are substantially (about 60 \%) inflated relative to the more-appropriate analyses that incorporate stimulus variation. Because all three tasks used the same stimulus words and faces, we could also meaningfully compare the relative contributions of stimulus variation across the tasks. In an appendix, we give syntax in R, SAS, and SPSS for fitting the recommended crossed random-effects models to data from all three tasks, as well as instructions on how to structure the data file.},

  abstract = {Network models are gaining popularity as a way to estimate direct effects among psychological variables and investigate the structure of constructs. A key feature of network estimation is determining which edges are likely to be non-zero. In psychology, this is commonly achieved through the graphical lasso regularization method that estimates a precision matrix of Gaussian variables using an {$\mathscr{l}$}1-penalty to push small values to zero. A tuning parameter, {$\lambda$}, controls the sparsity of the network. There are many methods to select {$\lambda$}, which can lead to vastly different graphs. The most common approach in psychological network applications is to minimize the extended Bayesian information criterion, but the consistency of this method for model selection has primarily been examined in high dimensional settings (i.e., n {$<$} p) that are uncommon in psychology. Further, there is some evidence that alternative selection methods may have superior performance. Here, using simulation, we compare four different methods for selecting {$\lambda$}, including the stability approach to regularization selection (StARS), K-fold cross-validation, the rotation information criterion (RIC), and the extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC). Our results demonstrate that penalty parameter selection should be made based on data characteristics and the inferential goal (e.g., to increase sensitivity versus to avoid false positives). We end with recommendations for selecting the penalty parameter when using the graphical lasso.},

We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions.

Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to consider generalizability from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

Science, 103, 677680] states that measurement levels should guide the choice of statistical test, such that the truth value of statements based on a statistical analysis remains invariant under admissible transformations of the data. Lord [Lord, F. M. (1953). On the statistical treatment of football numbers. American Psychologist, 8, 750\textendash{}751] challenged this theory. In a thought experiment, a parametric test is performed on football numbers (identifying players: a nominal representation) to decide whether a sample from the machine issuing these numbers should be considered non-random. This is an apparently illegal test, since its outcomes are not invariant under admissible transformations for the nominal measurement level. Nevertheless, it results in a sensible conclusion: the number-issuing machine was tampered with. In the ensuing measurement-statistics debate Lord's contribution has been influential, but has also led to much confusion. The present aim is to show that the thought experiment contains a serious flaw. First it is shown that the implicit assumption that the numbers are nominal is false. This disqualifies Lord's argument as a valid counterexample to Stevens' dictum. Second, it is argued that the football numbers do not represent just the nominal property of non-identity of the players; they also represent the amount of bias in the machine. It is a question about this property \textendash{} not a property that relates to the identity of the football players \textendash{} that the statistical test is concerned with. Therefore, only this property is relevant to Lord's argument. We argue that the level of bias in the machine, indicated by the population mean, conforms to a bisymmetric structure, which means that it lies on an interval scale. In this light, Lord's thought experiment \textendash{} interpreted by many as a problematic counterexample to Stevens' theory of admissible statistics \textendash{} conforms perfectly to Stevens' dictum.},
